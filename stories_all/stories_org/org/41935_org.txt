we decided to pack our truck and take a vacation to the beach .
we stopped off at a rest stop halfway to the beach and had breakfast .
we finally reached the bridge which led to the beach and it was incredible .
when we got to the beach the sun was shining off a large rock .
when the blue sky finally came out we took a great picture of ourselves .
