here is where we started our hike and the scenery does n't get any better then this .
just about stepped on mr. <unk> as he was crossing the trail .
just when i thought the hike could n't get any better we came across this very colorful field of flowers .
now this is refreshing and a much welcomed site .
i think that this is mother nature at her best and i expect wild horses to show up soon .
