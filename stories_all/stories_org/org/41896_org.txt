we rode our <unk> to the mountain top ...
and , suddenly , we were back on the beach and viewing a wondering opening .
i asked my husband to take a picture ; however , he preferred to stand behind the camera .
we then moved back to the mountain and saw a beautiful <unk>
the <unk> showed the strong power of the water moving in from the ocean . we took our picture and were ready for bed .
