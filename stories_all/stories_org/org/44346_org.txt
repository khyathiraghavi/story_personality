in the town square was holiday ice sculptures done and up for <unk> were so many it was so interesting to see .
<unk> ice sculpture on the ice <unk> was one of the smaller ones i did n't really care for but i still like it .
one of the <unk> characters sitting on the <unk> loved <unk> as a kid .
so many great sculptures to look at , i wonder how long they stay up or how long it takes to melt .
this had to take a long time to <unk> wonder how they did <unk> love this time of year .
