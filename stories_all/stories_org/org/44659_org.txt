the <unk> was <unk> <unk> on our city and we turned to god for help .
someone suggested the <unk> was brought by the men on the strange boat that had recently docked .
some continued to pray at whatever cross they found .
others met at the windmill to discuss the matter .
it was decided that the strangers had to go , so we formed an angry <unk> .
