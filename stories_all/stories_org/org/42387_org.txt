we 're off to location for the day but first - breakfast . and what better way to start the day than with bacon and fried potatoes . my <unk> might not love it but my belly is in heaven !
bacon 's ready and the family <unk> the kitchen . wow , look how much bacon my sister has grabbed . save some for the rest of us !
we catch the ferry and i hang out on the top deck to watch the waves with my brother . the motion of the ocean does n't seem to be <unk> with him . he looks quite green . i make sure i 'm not standing <unk> ...
getting off of this thing is going to be a real pain . look at all these cars . but we 're in location at last .
a quick photo with the boys on deck before we leave . look out location , he we come !
