the <unk> had many <unk> against <unk> .
the windows had outside bar <unk> . no one could get in or out of the windows .
barbed wire was rolled and lined the top of the cement block wall that surrounded the <unk> .
what was the <unk> keeping out ? or was it keeping something inside ? questions would be asked .
no answers were ever received . the sharp <unk> on the wire only <unk> the <unk> nature of the <unk> .
