we went in search of some art work by our favorite <unk> today .
some of the locations were a little run down and made us nervous .
the artwork , on the other hand , was amazing to see first hand .
the largest piece was by far my favorite of all his murals
after seeing all the murals we decided it was time for a lunch break .
