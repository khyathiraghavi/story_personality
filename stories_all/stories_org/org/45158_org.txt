i 've never been to the cottage in the winter . the whole lake was frozen .
you could literally walk across the the mountains in the distance .
we laid out some candles to keep warm at night .
the kids did some arts an crafts inside because it was too cold out .
at the end of the week though the snow melted , it was nice while it lasted .
