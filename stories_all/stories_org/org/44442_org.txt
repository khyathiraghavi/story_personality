the family all went to this shop called location <unk> .
we wandered on to this aisle and did n't really like anything except the pandas . that 's mom 's favorite animal !
then we came down to this aisle , `` aisle 3 `` , and i still enjoyed the panda aisle the most .
i think that this aisle is mostly games , and my brother at home would like this ! he plays on games all day !
this aisle was the same ! <unk> ! we should 've brought my brother . maybe next time !
