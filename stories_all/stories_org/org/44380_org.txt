we ate breakfast and decided to make a fun lunch .
we decided to make the meal from scratch and by ourselves .
it was messy and dirty work , but sister was up to the task .
the ingredients came together . we were all starting to get hungry .
when we were done we had made a wonderful and tasty meal .
