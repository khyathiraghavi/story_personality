upon arriving today at location location location location we were greeted by this fire danger sign .
we decided to go on a hike and find some <unk> natural sounds all around from local wild life was relaxing .
the beauty of the scenery made it easy to realize why there would be concern for fire safety .

we came over the hill to a clearing and saw the rest of the <unk> preparing for any sign of fire danger .
