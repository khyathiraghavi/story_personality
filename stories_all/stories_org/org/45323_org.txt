the little boy enjoyed playing with his toy dinosaur before the easter egg hunt began .
he even included his little brother in on the play when he decided to <unk> to his toy cars .
of course the toys were long forgotten once the egg hunt began .
the little boy found a lot of eggs but his favorite was by far those filled with chocolate .
the adults were all tired after hiding the eggs and helping the children find them .
