we were ready and prepared to participate in the dog sledding race .
all the dogs were ready as well , they were excited to get going .
as they took off , you could feel the excitement in the air .
number 50 waves to the fans as the sled passes by .
these dogs work hard , but they are very much rewarded for their efforts and hard work .
