on our vacation we traveled through several small towns , each one of them unique .
outside of the towns we often saw rolling <unk> lined with flowers .
the <unk> , in turn , were lined with rocky mountain cliffs , such as this one .
laying between the mountains and the <unk> were some beautiful rivers .
finally after passing over one last mountain , we arrived at the beach . our vacation destination was achieved .
