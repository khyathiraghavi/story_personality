this small fishing town along the coast brings in some of the best fish sold in the local markets .
they head out daily to get their <unk> before too many non commercial fishermen get out there .
one of their biggest competitors are the <unk> though .
most come in before they need to <unk> on the lighthouse in case of bad weather .
they all agree hands down that fish or no fish the sunsets ca n't be beat .
