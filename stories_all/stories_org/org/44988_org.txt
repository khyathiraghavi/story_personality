the big parade in our city is a study in <unk> . there are girls dressed up so <unk> like this one here .
i love seeing the <unk> <unk> around !
the clothes they wear are so incredibly , and the props are huge .
however , then there 's also very traditional parade elements , like a brass and drum band .
you ca n't get much more traditional than this marching band , and i love that too . it 's great we can include many elements in our parade !
