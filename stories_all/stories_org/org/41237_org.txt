we took a lovely trip in the river while on vacation .
we saw a bunch of different animals . look at the long <unk> .
a duck is sitting in the grass taking a rest .
a lot of different looking buildings . they are beautiful .
i loved the ferris wheel ride along side the river . you could also see the building wonderfully .
