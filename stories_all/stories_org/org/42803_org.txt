it was our weekly gathering at the bar for playing board games .
we waited patiently for our late arrival . we wo n't start without him .
there he is , late as usual . but he 's a great guy so all is <unk> .
we put the games away when we were treated to an unexpected show .
it was <unk> and fun . a nice change from our routine .
