the festival of lights started off with lots of <unk> on the <unk> .
the trees were <unk> in lights and there was even a canadian flag .
there were also <unk> displays that you had to get closer to see .
the walkway had arches with lights on them to show you the way .
my girlfriend and i enjoyed ourselves .
