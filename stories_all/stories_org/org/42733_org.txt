it was my birthday and my friends took me to the county fair .
lots of great food there . i happen to love funnel cakes .
they had an exhibition of a dog playing with a frisbee . the dog was better than me at catching .
when we got home there was another surprise . they had a happy birthday cake .
the cake was vanilla and chocolate with <unk> cookies . i 'm a lucky girl !
