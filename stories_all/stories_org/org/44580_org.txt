my husband and i went on vacation and found this quaint town .
it was christmas time and the town was getting ready to have their winter festival .
we were invited to take part in decorating the town tree .
the entire town went to the festival , everywhere else was deserted .
afterwards we went over to the train station to continue on our journey .
