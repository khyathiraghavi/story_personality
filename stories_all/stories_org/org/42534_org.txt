when the bike race started , the seats in the venue were pretty empty .
the racers all posed for a <unk> photo shoot .
the race was pretty competitive .
it was exciting seeing so many bikes close together .
i have to admit , we almost wished the bicycles would crash , as that would have been fun to see !
