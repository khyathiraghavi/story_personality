today was the day the family learned some american history at college creek .
they had <unk> of everything , ready for a <unk> at the drop of a hat .
i love the way the grass was cut , it looked like there were tiny rows in the <unk> .
there was n't any water around , so they built a replica of a ship that was used during the time , but a little smaller .
last of all , we got to see some of the guns that were used buy the <unk> !
