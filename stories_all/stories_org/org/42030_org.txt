our overseas trip was amazing . this was the skyline when flying into the airport .
first day we went to a dance club , it was crowded but fun .
we also went to the beach , here are we going for our day trip .
the next day we went on a big boat ride in the harbor .
and at the end we went shopping in a multi level mall , it was amazing !
