spent a day walking and taking pictures at a very old graveyard .
some tombstones were so old they were hard to read .
this one had the <unk> date i could find ... <unk>
many of the headstones were parents or husband and wife .
was a very thoughtful day ... <unk> to wonder if any family still visits these graves
