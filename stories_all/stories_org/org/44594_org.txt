early this morning we left our <unk> apartment in the city .
we saw some strange art of a man <unk> on to a window <unk> .
shortly after , something even stranger : a car covered with <unk> notes .
with that excitement out of the way , we stopped by a super fancy ice cream place .
we finished off the day with a breathtaking view of the cityscape at night .
