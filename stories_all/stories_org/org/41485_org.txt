the lights show started near dusk .
as the sun set , the beautiful lights began to shine .
each building had it 's own unique light set up . my friends and i were impressed .
in the dead of night , they let off fireworks to accompany the lit buildings .
we decided to take <unk> photos to remember the night of the beautiful lights .
