the parade started and was lead by the extreme ice cream truck , a fan favorite .
then , to many 's amazement , it appeared to be a bicyclist ...
followed by a <unk> of horses . quite a sight .
when the location location location arrived , folks cheered .
and , the show ended with a rather awkward looking creature finishing up the parade . folks laughed as it drove by .
