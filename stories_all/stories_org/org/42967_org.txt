spending time with friends is really great .
i enjoy having a nice meal with friends , so i eat out with them often .
last night , i was in the mood for some sushi rolls , so we went to a japanese restaurant .
my husband and his brother looked at me in shock , because they know i do n't even like seafood .
their expressions was all the <unk> i needed to go through with it , even though i honestly was having second <unk> at that point !
