that afternoon was much like any other day . the brothers spent time riding their bikes and having fun .
but when they got home , there were two surprises waiting . the older brother saw his surprise first : a pet <unk> . he named it <unk> .
the second surprise was waiting for them in their bedroom : a black lab . the younger brother held it and smiled . it wore a pretty blue <unk> and they named it blue .
blue loved to sit and watch the boys as they watched tv in the living room . he would look up at them and study their expressions .
blue also loved to play outside in the grass . he became their best friend .
