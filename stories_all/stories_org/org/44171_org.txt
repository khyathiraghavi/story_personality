today we went to the <unk> first attraction we saw , was the fun house .
the fun house had mirrors that made your body look very funny and look as if it where shaped oddly .
the second ride was the <unk> . i was bright and made you do flips in a cage .
we went really high in the air and flipped a lot of times . the sun even set while we where in the air .
we said goodbye to the carnival on our final ride , the <unk> wheel . it lifted us high enough to slowly watch the whole carnival .
