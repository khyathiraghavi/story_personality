the day was gloomy and the stained glass was made darker by the lack of light from the sun .
i realized , i must use my camera on my <unk> so i could later identify the statues .
i was alone , but i could feel that i was being watched .
but always ready and willing for a selfie . maybe , they might think i 'm a tourist .
finally , i compared the statues . damn ! they do n't match . my search continues .
