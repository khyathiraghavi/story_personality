i went on a trip to location with a lot of college friends . i loved seeing the classic old buildings .
on a walk at night , i was overcome by the spooky beauty of the organization organization in the distance .
the bright lights of the strip contrasted with the old parts of the city .
we all gathered at a pub for a toast to old times and new memories .
then we had a typical english food buffet . i must admit food was n't the best part of the trip !
