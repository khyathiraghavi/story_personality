it 's spring time and we decided to throw a spring party . first , the husband cleaned up the yard and hung some bird houses .
our son came outside to help .
our neighbors came over to share a bit of wine on the deck .
then we moved inside to eat supper .
finally , my husband surprised me with my very own hammock in the yard !
