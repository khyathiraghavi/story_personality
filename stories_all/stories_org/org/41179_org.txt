we parked our car in the parking lot , there were many security guards present for the event .
the hotel where the event is taking place is a very tall building with many floors .
on top of the building there is a big circle display of lights .
the display changes patterns of the light constantly .
from the roof of the building , we can see a very nice view of the city all lighted up .
