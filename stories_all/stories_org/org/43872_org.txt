it was a long hike through the scenic country side to get to the ruins .
the first building we saw as we headed into the ruins . it was the most complete of the ruins .
the <unk> was very hard to recognize from the road because of how low the seats were .
there was a local cat that was there , watching us as we looked around .
once we got back , we checked out the market to pick up some <unk> .
