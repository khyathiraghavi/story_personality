once a year , we go on an annual camping trip up to the woods .
we pitch a tent on the grass and set some chairs up so we can have a nice evening
we make a campfire and spend time talking and relaxing .
this year we had watermelon and soup with some iced tea for supper .
even the dog had a great time at this year 's camping trip !
