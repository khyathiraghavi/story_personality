i was really looking forward to the day trip to the mountains . the bus dropped us off at the <unk> , and we had all day to explore .
i was by myself , so i decided to hike up to the mountain .
i crossed the fields , and i realized the mountains were not going to be as easy as i had thought .
i decided to hike in another direction , and that is how i found this small creek .
i followed it to this beach , and i spent the rest of my day there . it was sad to have to go back to the <unk> when the day was over .
