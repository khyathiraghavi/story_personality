we were very excited to explore the nearby forest .
we entered the field and ran quickly to the forest edge .
we stopped at a river in the woods and watched the fish go past .
[ male ] thought he saw a bear in the woods but i do n't think so .
we even found an abandoned house that was full of old pictures . we had a great time that day .
