as i took a stroll around my <unk> , i saw one of my neighbors house is close to a cemetery .
this was the entrance to that cemetery .
the next stop on the stroll , led me to a church , where the inside was quite peaceful .
this lady sat here for over an hour reading her bible , and she did not even notice me .
my daughter wanted a picture with the church as her background .
