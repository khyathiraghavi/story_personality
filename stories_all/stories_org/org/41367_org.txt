the outside of the building looked like a beautifully aged photograph .
so i was surprised to see how beautifully colored the inside was .
even the somewhat gray buildings had brilliant <unk> of red .
we finally joined the crowed around the stage .
finally , i took a few minutes to enjoy the waterfall outside the building itself .
