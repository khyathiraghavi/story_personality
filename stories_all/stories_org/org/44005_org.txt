i also love the old clock spires of yesterday and i have often stared in wonder at how they managed to build them with out modern building techniques and equipment .
even such things as indoor and outdoor lighting <unk> and lantern holders are pieces of art to be admired today .
the history of <unk> and how they built walls and castles in the old days , to <unk> against their <unk> , is a science still studied today in our modern day military schools like location location .
brick was not just a <unk> outside layer back in the old days because that was mostly all they had to <unk> against cannon fire and even <unk> attack and even this arch is an amazing feet for the time <unk> great skill and knowledge gained from the past .
