the <unk> had displays in a <unk> shelf with a bench along side it .
as they walked up the stairs they could see banners outside the windows .
once upstairs they were welcomed by a large informative poster .
they were able to watch some of the artists at work .
when they reached the top floor , they could look down on the patio where many of the artists would spend their breaks .
