he really wanted to get his wife away from all these skyscraper buildings .
he decided to take her to a beautiful <unk> hotel .
there was a gorgeous courtyard which they sat at in the evening .
she loved the beautiful sky with <unk> white clouds .
the beach was so wonderful ; they hated to go back home at the end of the long weekend getaway .
