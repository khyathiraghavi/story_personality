there once was a city in <unk> disrepair from a lot of gang violence .
the people of the neighborhood , took pride in their work and wanted to <unk> their community to reflect their pride .
so they began to <unk> the city with colorful vibrant artwork all over the buildings .
they even decorated the streets and sidewalks with artwork .
within no time their city reflected the pride the citizens had within themselves , and they began to <unk> as a tourist town .
