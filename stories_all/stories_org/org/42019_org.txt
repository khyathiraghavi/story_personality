our family arrived at our annual beach vacation location .
i immediately claimed a spot on the beach , pulled out a book to read , and took a glorious nap .
when i woke up , i played in the waves with the kids .
we watched the seagulls flying into the air while we ran into the waves .
dad got all dressed up for a nice dinner we had planned later , while we were still in our <unk> enjoying the sun .
