the family this year finally decided to take a trip to organization 's location adventure !
we had never been to location before , and thought it would be a great opportunity to visit location and this unique park .
the paradise pier area was a family favorite . the weather was fantastic and there were so many amazing sites to see .
we especially loved the dining , various stores and areas to shop around throughout organization .
we all left with many souvenirs . it was a fantastic trip none of us will forget .
