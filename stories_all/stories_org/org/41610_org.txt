my sister and i went camping in location last weekend .
she 's not an outdoor person but she handled it pretty well when it started raining .
when it started raining , the alligators came up out of the water .
one of them bit her foot so they rushed her to the visitor <unk> .
lucky for her , she had leather boots on and only got a red mark from the whole <unk> .
