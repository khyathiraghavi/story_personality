everyone was very excited to tour the art gallery .
the room was very crowded so we had a hard time seeing some of the pieces .
the best room was filled with brightly colored artwork , everyone loved it .
we even had the pleasure of meeting one of the lead artists .
we had a great time at the art gallery that day .
