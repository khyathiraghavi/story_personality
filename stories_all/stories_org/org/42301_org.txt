we started the day off at the beach by enjoying a beautiful sunrise .
we brought an umbrella and lounged around , enjoying the beautiful day .
we caught a glimpse of some wild <unk> that roam the area .
around lunch time we started to get hungry so we headed over to captain [ male ] 's restaurant .
the meal really hit the spot . dessert sounded so amazing that i decided not to share .
