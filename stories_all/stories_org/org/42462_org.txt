i took a trip through an old medieval town , and took pictures of an old castle .
there was a bridge running over the small river that ran through the town .
nearby was a very old cathedral that i absolutely loved .
my friend gave me a guitar , which i brought with me to play at night .
in the center of town was an art installation inspired by the decorations on the cathedral .
