the goal was to reach the top of this mountain with group by <unk> .
there were about 20 of us following our guide and it was a tough <unk> climb
at the top , we had a breathtaking view , it 's like we could touch the clouds .
we all stopped and had lunch under a large cross near the top .
we had a great time wandering around a nearby river and just admiring the scenery .
