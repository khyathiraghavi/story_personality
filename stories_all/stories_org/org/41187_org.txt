the skyline reflected in the water was pretty , but i 'm not great at nighttime photos .
here is the gang of us all together at the water 's edge . too dark to see us clearly .
this is a closer shot of the guests of honor for our reunion .
the skyline in the early evening is the best shot i took all weekend .
this is one of the few daytime pictures i have of the city where our reunion was held . i called the clock `` little [ male ] . ``
