out trip to the canyon provided us with so many amazing views .
there was much more to do there than just look at the views .
we encountered an area with guides that gave us demonstrations .
many of the guides wore uniforms so we knew they worked at the park .
the walking paths were spacious and had many different places to stop to take photos .
