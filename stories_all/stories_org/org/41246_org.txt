we had a great time on the 4th hanging with some friends out by the location location location .
the pier was bustling with people , but we managed to go on a few of the rides .
as you can imagine , the beach was a zoo , but it sure beat the valley heat .
once the sun went down , everything cooled off , and soon the fireworks show began .
the pier is also a really happening place for entertainment , and you 'll always be sure to find many street performers .
