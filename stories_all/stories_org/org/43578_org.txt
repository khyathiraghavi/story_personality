<unk> was excited to visit the village
that was in the middle of nowhere .
he loved to see their unique structures ,
and he loved watching the villagers work hard for what they got .
he also thought it was amazing that they rode elephants in the middle of the street ! <unk> was able to ride one , and he thought to himself , man , this village really knows how to live life right .
