he waited patiently at the fountain for grandma .
he was a good grandson by all <unk> .
each week he would go get his grandma and take her where ever she wanted to go .
sometimes he picked her up at home in his old suv since grandma could n't walk very far anymore .
other times he would push her in her wheel chair because he remembered all the walks she use to take him on when he was just a boy .
