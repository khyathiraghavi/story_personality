a really bad storm came through our area last night and caused a lot of damage .
some people <unk> it was a tornado because it tore off some roofs .
trees were snapped like <unk> everywhere you looked .
this fellow was lucky his vehicle was only <unk> .
streets to the area were closed off . police only allowed you in if you could prove you lived there .
