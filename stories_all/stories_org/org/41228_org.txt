the band was excited and a bit anxious to start their first performance .
after a few mic checks and nervous <unk> , the band got in position to play their favorite song .
it was only a minute into the song when the lead singer got enough courage to really start giving his all in the performance .
inspired by the singers enthusiasm , the drummer and <unk> both got really into the song and played harder .
the drummer may have gone <unk> when he began to play a ten minute drum solo at the end of the band 's performance .
