we arrived at the parade and immediately spotted a man in a bright hat leading the way .
the parade began moving past as women dressed in vibrant colors danced in a wild <unk> .
everyone from the largest man to the smallest child was decked out in bright attire .
the sound of <unk> drums filled our ears as skilled drummers began marching past in a procession .
we could n't believe how amazing this unique culture was , we had a great day watching the rest of the parade .
