we were very excited for our trip to location location city .
we walked around and the streets were bustling with <unk> <unk> their wares .
we stopped at a monument and made sure to take lots of photos together .
we were hungry so we stopped for lunch at a street food car .
we saw all sorts of unique signs but this national <unk> sign was our favorite . the trip was just amazing !
