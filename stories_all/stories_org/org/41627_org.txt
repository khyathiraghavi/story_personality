we went for a boating holiday on the river last week .
it was incredibly relaxing just floating along enjoying the beauty of nature .
[ female ] even let the sun see her legs !
we stopped for a picnic on the banks of the river . it was fantastic .
we joked that this was a duck <unk> <unk> . the first one seen in this country in the wild !
