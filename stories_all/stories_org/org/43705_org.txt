we were very excited to be traveling to location for the summer .
we decided to visit an abandoned farm to explore .
the scenery was stunning but the farm was in ruins .
we saw a lone cow sitting in the field and decided not to bother it .
we spent the entire day wandering around the acres of <unk> in location . it was an amazing part of our trip to location .
