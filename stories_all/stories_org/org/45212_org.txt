it snowed heavily last night . there were icicles hanging off the side of our roof .
the neighbors also had icicles on theirs .
our cars were snowed in so i had to start digging them out .
it took me awhile but i eventually cleared enough to get out . later the snow <unk> cleared the main street .
unfortunately , it snowed again tonight and i 'm going to have to do it all over again tomorrow .
