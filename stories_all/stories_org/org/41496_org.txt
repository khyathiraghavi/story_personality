we attended my aunt 's wedding at this famous <unk> , where the couple had met .
on the way to the harbor i saw so many boats , <unk> , and even ships .
this is the ship that my aunt rented for her wedding reception .
even from a higher <unk> , the ship looked massive .
when the ship reached this perfect spot , the couple paused for photos .
