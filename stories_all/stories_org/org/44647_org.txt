the stained glass windows each showed a different saint .
they all look very strong and beautiful but i do n't have any idea who any of them are .
they were built a long time ago and can be seen as you enter the church and look down the <unk> .
some of the walls had carvings on them too . they depicted hell .
they are usually found above the doors .
