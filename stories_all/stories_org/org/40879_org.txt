our family loves nature , so we went on a hike .
the views were great , we had to stay close .
although we got to break off and explore a little bit .
here we are up near the top . it was a long way for little legs .
at the very top is a super amazing view , but its a little bit scary too . our whole family loves doing these hikes .
