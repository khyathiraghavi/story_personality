there 's always a lot of traffic when we head down to our camping site .
here i am standing on the docks before we got out of town .
this is a beautiful waterfall near where we camped . the water was so clear .
at night we made our fire in this pit . there was plenty of old wood around to keep it going all night .
here 's my tent the first morning i woke up . just before i took this picture a rabbit ran through .
