we took an impromptu visit to the zoo with my son .
this goat was not in the mood to come out at all .
this one was a lot more friendly and posed for a picture !
this monkey was chilling and trying to stay away from the heat .
the day was perfect and my little man was very pleased with seeing all the animals .
