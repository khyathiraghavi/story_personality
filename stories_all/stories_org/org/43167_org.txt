the windmill seems to be the only man made structure seen for miles .
this windmill seems so old fashioned compared to the ones in the back ground .
these rock structures have been here for millions of years .
the structures make an awe inspiring view .
it would seem that <unk> also appreciated the rock structures and wanted all that passed here to know .
