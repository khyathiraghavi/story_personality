the boats all lay on the shore in the morning hours .
one boy decided to see if the boat was any fun to use .
on the opposite side of the lake , there was a bird enjoying the crisp , summer day .
people were on the beach having a good time with the water .
later on that day , people gathered in the boats and set sail .
