we took a long drive up into the mountains to a beautiful park .
as evening fell , we decided to pitch a tent and settle in for the night .
inside the tent , we told scary stories and ate snacks .
in the morning , we realized the scenery was perfect for taking pictures , and dreamed of what it would be like to climb to the very top of the mountain .
we took a hike and enjoyed the nearby scenery , like the trees whose leaves were changing color for fall .
