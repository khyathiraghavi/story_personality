i looked into the mirror to make sure i looked great
because my crazy friends were coming to get me to have lunch , do some stuffed animal shopping and go bowling .
first stop , lunch , oh it was great and the cake us wonderful .
then off to get my gift for my nephew
and then topped off the beautiful day with some night time bowling . it was a fantastic day !
