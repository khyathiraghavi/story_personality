this is location and [ male ] . [ male ] sings and [ male ] plays guitar .
location is an awesome singer but that was n't enough . he wanted to play guitar like [ male ] but his fingers were too <unk> .
this ate away at location . one day during a church gig he got on his <unk> and prayed that god would let him play guitar even better than [ male ] .
an angel appeared to location and said there were too many guitar players . the world needs <unk> <unk> players [ male ] .
suddenly [ male ] felt <unk> to grab a <unk> and <unk> out a tune . he was so happy . until he tried to put it down . the angel had forgotten to say the release <unk> prayer . so now [ male ] and his instrument are stuck together for <unk> .
