we walked into <unk> , ready for a night on the town .
the <unk> were amazing , and we , unfortunately , filled up on them .
i had n't had hot cross buns since i was a kid , so i had to buy a few of those .
after our heavy spending , the wait staff was nice enough to let us snap a few pictures of the kitchen .
we probably spent too much , but this was a nice start to a decent night out .
