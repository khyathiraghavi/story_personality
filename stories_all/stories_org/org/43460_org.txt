the day she left was rather wet and dreary .
we had to cross the street in order to get to the bus <unk> location .
her <unk> become quite heavy after walking just a few blocks .
one last embrace as the motor coach will be arriving soon .
the motor coach finally arrived and she was happy to have her luggage loaded and sit down .
