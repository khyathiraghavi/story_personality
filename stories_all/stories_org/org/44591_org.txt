we had arrived at the hotel , ready to get a good nights sleep before going into town tomorrow .
the next morning we went on a self guided art tour of the town . this particular piece is so realistic that many have called the police for assistance .
there was also some more traditional art that we saw on our tour .
my favorite art on the tour was some of the architecture that we saw on so many buildings , like this one .
even our desert after the tour seemed to become a work of art . it had been a great day .
