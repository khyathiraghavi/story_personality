my husband and some friends came with me to the baseball game .
they got to take pictures on the field .
we were n't the only ones attending the game , i saw plenty of my coworkers .
the game started off slow in the beginning .
but soon it picked up and we were all hyped up on <unk> , hoping our favorite team won .
