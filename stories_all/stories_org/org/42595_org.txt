everyone was meeting up on the trails for a day of riding .
the trail was rough at certain points but it was exciting to hit the jumps .
we all had to <unk> carefully as we rode down a muddy hill .
everyone had to watch their balance as we crossed a log <unk> over a creek .
it was a tough and muddy ride but we all had a great time .
