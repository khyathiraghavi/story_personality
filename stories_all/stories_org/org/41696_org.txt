visiting my local comedy club this often has gotten me used to some pretty impressive performances .
such as a performance where to <unk> bring a lot of <unk> while sitting on a couch and talking as if they are in your living room .
or <unk> where a bunch of different <unk> pretend to be at a party , each thing of random things about the other .
of course you also get <unk> were two <unk> go at it , not just with words , but physical humor .
last but not least however ; are those <unk> who can play well and tell great jokes to .
