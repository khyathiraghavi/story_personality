we decided to go to location on vacation this year .
location was absolutely beautiful , i love how the buildings sit right on the water .
the architecture was amazing , we do n't have buildings like these in the states .
we took a gondola down the canal , it was very <unk> .
the food was very different than i 'm used to , i never was quite sure what i was eating .
