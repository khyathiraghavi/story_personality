after church today i decided to take a few pictures of the windows in my church .
the <unk> are all stained glass .
each one painted differently and each one <unk> beautiful .
the outside of my church is grand . it 's so large .
i love going to my church . it <unk> in the distance calling out for me to come visit again .
