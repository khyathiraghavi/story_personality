road trip ! another weekend , another opportunity to see the country .
the views along the highway were breathtaking .
we stopped for breakfast at the greatest little cafe .
the nightlife in the town was pretty active considering how small it was .
we made some new friends and ended up staying up all night . we really hope to return soon .
