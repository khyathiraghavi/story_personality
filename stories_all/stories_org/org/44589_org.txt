we began the grey day at the crack of dawn by attending church .
after a long , cold day of family celebrations the sun was setting and night began to fall .
heading downtown i began to feel excitement when the big cities lights began to light up the area .
we had a fantastic time sharing drinks with friends in a crowded bar .
the night ended with take out food and cigarettes being scattered throughout the living room after a night of drinks .
