iron man and like competitions have become more and more popular every year and it seems that the ones i have watched usually start early with the swimming part going first .
these cross training style events can only be won or even finished by the some of the best athletes in the world .
the second leg of the these events usually is the biking part which really puts a lot of these contestants to the test .
each competitor is given a number like we see here worn in his shorts area and it appears that many of the more well know competitors have sponsors .
only a world class <unk> can win one of these races and even finishing one is a huge <unk> to be proud of and while this man may not be running right now , he is still not too tired to hold up the stars and stripes to show his patriotism .
