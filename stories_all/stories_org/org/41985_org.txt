our family got together for an amazing vacation to see the ocean .
the closer we got to the beach , i could smell the salt water on my taste buds .
i could see the beach getting closer and i became very anxious .
the beach extended as far as the eye could see .
when we got closer to our beach spot , i could see surfers out in the water looking for the best wave .
