sunday our family went to church .
my younger sister and i went to the youth group service .
and our parents went to the regular service .
afterward the pastor met the different people that attended church . he 's very nice and talks to everyone who wants to talk to him . sometimes he <unk> for them .
this is one of the crosses located on the inside . it 's my favorite .
