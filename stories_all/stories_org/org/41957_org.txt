i decided to quit my job and move to an island , for a big change of pace .
the island was almost deserted . the geese were my only friends .
in solitude , i had time to <unk> the small things in life .
i thought a lot about myself , and the direction in which i had been headed , and where i wanted to go now .
in <unk> places , i found words of wisdom , and i continued on my journey .
