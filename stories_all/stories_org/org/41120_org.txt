a large town square full of ornate statues and really neat buildings .
i found some really neat <unk> and <unk> . it 's so cold here .
after driving around for about an hour we found this really neat spot . the road is <unk> so high . we drove clear to the top .
when we got to the top we saw this beautiful picturesque view of location . it was breathtaking !
