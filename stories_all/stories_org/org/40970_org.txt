when grandmother got mad , she would take off and travel .
we never knew where she was but often the locals would take a photo for us so we would know she was safe .
in this photo , she is enjoying a beer a her favorite pub .
after a visit to the pub , she always takes a walk to the bus stop .
she always comes back home and says how horrible it was and that she walked the whole way home , but we always know better .
