i went to look at a bike for sale . it had great details like <unk> handle <unk> .
the tire has a <unk> of green .
i could tell it was a well made bike , one that was very expensive <unk> .
it was <unk> even though it was a performance bike .
i decided not to buy it in the end , because it was too expensive , but i took a long last look at it .
