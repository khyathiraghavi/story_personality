my name is [ male ] <unk> . i am lonely .
i use to go out with my <unk> to the trains .
until one day i walked into a little house by mistake and was never the same .
i am now <unk> to spoken words . i cant go to social events anymore without dying .
the thing i missed the most is old ladies saying i am handsome .
