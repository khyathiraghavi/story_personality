my family went to location for a summer vacation .
my children really loved the arcade downtown .
there were funny mirrors in the halls of the arcade my son liked to take pictures at .
we walked to the pier to get a better view of the light house looking out on location location .
my daughter wanted to stop at the huge anchor for a picture on our way to the light house .
