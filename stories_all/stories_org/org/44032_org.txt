our family took a trip to this church today .
people still attend services and the inside is very modern .
here 's our girl next to the church - notice the beautiful windows .
she had so much fun sitting in the old fashioned desk and seeing what kids used to use in school .
it was fun to see the way teachers would write in <unk> on the old <unk> .
