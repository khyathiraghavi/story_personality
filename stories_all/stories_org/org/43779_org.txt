i 've <unk> my luggage away and i 'm ready to set sail on my once in a lifetime vacation .
to pass the time , i ate a small meal in my room .
the first thing i noticed upon arrival was the sparkling blue ocean and white sand .
i dared my friend to go flying .
she took the dare and flew high like a kite .
