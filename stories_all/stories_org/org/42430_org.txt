the weather was perfect for the first day of our vacation . we sat on the shore and watched the sailboats for a <unk> .
we moved farther down the shoreline , taking in the gorgeous views .
we stopped at a local museum to learn about the the history of the area .
we chose a shady spot to for a picnic lunch outdoors .
we went back to our hotel in town at the end of the day .
