i woke up and looked out my window after i heard <unk> <unk> and a loud crash . i saw a man running down the street as his car burst into flames .
i called <unk> as i watched the fire get bigger . i could smell the burning <unk> .
firemen quickly showed up and made people stand back as they fought the <unk> .
soon they were able to put the fire out before it spread . everyone was relieved .
i told the police i saw the driver running away from the scene . i hope they find him <unk> . that was scary .
