took a ride down the river over the weekend .
while we were out we saw a bird sitting on a bank .
once we got closer we realized there were two birds .
one was pink and was just sitting in the sand . we thought it might be hurt .
the other bird was more white and would not let us even get close to see if the other was injured or not .
