everyone was having fun at the family reunion .
one <unk> thing : father kept <unk> everyone about the fireworks he was going to set off .
he 'd corner some poor soul and talk about where he got them , how much he paid , how wonderful they would be .
when night came , we all prepared ourselves for the big show .
it was entertaining , i 'll admit , watching dad holding the <unk> <unk> in his hands .
