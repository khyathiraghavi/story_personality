we had to go visit the gay capitol of the world after <unk> marriage was <unk> .
our trip was truly amazing , the city streets were just as steep as we thought they were .
our friends got married as soon as they got there .
we got the chance to take a look at the scenery around location location with views of the golden gate .
we finished our day with a lovely walk through golden gate park .
