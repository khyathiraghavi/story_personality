today started off like an ordinary work day . little did i know that today would be different than all the rest !
i walked along the crowded location location streets until i came to my office building . i went in and started to work .
at the end of the day , i finally got the courage to ask my coworker out . we walked the town and talked a lot .
we had a great dinner in a restaurant here . we really hit it off .
we talked until dawn , and then i walked her home to her apartment . i ca n't wait to see her again !
