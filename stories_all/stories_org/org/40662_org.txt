dad and i had a great time at the organization game on <unk> .
even mom enjoyed herself after a beer , though we could n't get her to admit it later .
here 's the ticket my work <unk> for us .
i had a beer myself , because what 's a baseball game without it ?
downtown was surprisingly quiet after the game , so we stopped for an early dinner at location 's .
