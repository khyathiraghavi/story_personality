we were thankful to have found such a beautiful cake for their anniversary , at the last minute .
everyone was grateful to be able to be there for the occasion .
the cousins talked and laughed about memories of when the business first started up .
it is nice to have such a wonderful team behind the company .
at the end we handed out memorabilia so everyone can remember that we are family .
