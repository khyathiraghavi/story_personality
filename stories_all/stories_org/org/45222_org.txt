i go to estate and garage sales and buy boxes of photos , among other antiques .
i 'm not sure what to say about this but collecting them makes me feel like each one has a story to tell .
those faces so fresh and bright , memories of things and places that those photos hold always <unk> me when i look at them .
so many memories held in <unk> . these photos mark a time in a moment that can not be <unk> .
it is amazing to me to find these photos and making my own stories and memories of these strangers . i love these old treasures .
