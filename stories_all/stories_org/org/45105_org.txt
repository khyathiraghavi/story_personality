time for the annual craft fair so i hopped in the car and headed straight there .
saw many lovely picnic baskets .
the jewelry , while a bit large , was very <unk> to buy as gift for mom .
some presents came <unk> , though i was <unk> to buy without touching .
i am can not <unk> a moose item so i bought a <unk> card .
