me and a few of my best friends went to the beach .
my <unk> was <unk> of the water but was a <unk> about it .
as the day went on she got closer and closer to the water .
near the end of the day she stepped into it for the first time .
i was so happy at the end of the day . my <unk> had shared a moment with me .
