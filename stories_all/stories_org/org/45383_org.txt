the bride was glad to have an outdoor wedding , but her bridesmaids were nervous about the bridge .
the view was spectacular , however , and the bride knew this would make the day memorable forever .
she especially liked how the small creek <unk> and <unk> as it flowed across the rocks .
she did home that the train on the <unk> did n't blow a horn and <unk> her wedding .
she also liked that some of the trees had leaves that turned to beautiful red colors . it was almost autumn , but still warm and beautiful outside .
