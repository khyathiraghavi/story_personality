i decided to go for a hike .
i was n't familiar with the area , so i paid a lot of attention to where i was putting my feet .
at one point , i almost stepped on a giant mushroom . it was <unk> and gross . it smelled a little odd , too .
the trail i was walking led to a small cabin in a clearing .
the cabin looked old , but it was actually a new building designed to look old . it served as a <unk> room for a cell tower .
