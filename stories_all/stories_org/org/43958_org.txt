i love trains very much , i also love going to train shows each year and looking at different models .
this is a <unk> model , built in <unk> , i like to call it the <unk> express because of the colors .
i moved on to the <unk> or what i like to call the <unk> potter express train , one of my favorites .
here we have a rare train car . only 3 were made , i wish i could have one . main reason i come to these train shows .
the final train i looked at was this beauty ; the silver bullet , one of the fastest trains in the world .
