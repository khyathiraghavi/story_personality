we went for a visit to the place where we plan to get married last week .
my husband held me close with the sun setting in the background .
i felt at such peace i could have fallen asleep on his shoulder .
i got my husband to take a picture of me holding up my hands inside the room .
the berries that grew on the green tree were breathtaking to see .
