early in the afternoon we decided to take a trip down to the wharf .
first we stopped to eat at our favorite fish restaurant .
for dessert , we bought some fresh <unk> .
we enjoyed our snack while watch the workers loading one of the big ships .
at the end of the day we stopped to watch the sunset and listen to the waves .
