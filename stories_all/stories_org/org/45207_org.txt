it was a beautiful cloud covered morning at the beach ...
the <unk> were enjoying their <unk>
just as i enjoyed my <unk> and coffee to begin the day .
we then walked the dog down the pier and enjoyed the rest of the cool day <unk>
it was dinner time ! nothing like steak and potatoes to end the evening right !
