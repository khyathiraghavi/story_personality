for the summer i took a trip with my brother back to my hometown in location .
on the day we arrived the city was busy and filled with many people .
the <unk> machines were new and unique at the airport . they caught my attention because i had never seen them before .
the nightlife in the city was amazing . i would love to spend the nights here every night if i could .
taking the trip brought memories of my wonderful family . i will always love location and have a place for my home in my heart .
