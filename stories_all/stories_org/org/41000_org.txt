today we took a trip to the zoo .
we saw exciting architecture , this place has wonderful buildings .
we saw a penguin at the zoo , such an interesting animal .
we also saw a polar bear , one of my favorite animals .
they even had fun head in hole boards . look at the face he 's making , he 's so goofy .
