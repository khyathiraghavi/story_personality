the hurricane whipped through my hometown earlier this year .
we saw trees with <unk> taken out of them from the high winds .
the tree down the block from my house had branches broken .
the debris from the storm was piled up everywhere .
i went out after the storm ended , and a heavy mist still hung over everything .
