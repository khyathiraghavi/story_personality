today was parents night at my school , lots of parents were waiting to meet the teachers .
my mom met my <unk> teacher and were joking about when i dropped my <unk> in class and everyone laughed .
mom wanted to talk to my teacher alone for a minute to make sure that i 've been good so far this year .
once that my mom got done talking to him my science teacher came in to meet everyone , too .
before we were all done my class mates all wanted to take a picture together with our teacher .
