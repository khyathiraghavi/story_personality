i 'm so excited to tell you my story , the story of deep impact ! ( i 'd like to note i was not the one to come up with the name for this program )
today we 've put together a meeting with other kids in the astronaut program .
i get to share with them photos from my last trip to the moon .
the <unk> were my favorite part to show them , i told them the biggest <unk> pictured housed an alien family who treated me to dinner .
big mistake since i had to finish up the meeting with q & a 's , <unk> % of the questions were about the <unk> ( my alien family ) .
