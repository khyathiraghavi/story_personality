the ocean is so calming . let 's just stay here all day .
we took a walk down the beach looking for shells .
came across this sticking out of the sand . no clue what it is or what was written on it . we kept walking .
that is a big rock for this beach . wonder who is putting this stuff here .
what in the world is that ? i did n't know anyone lived here , but i 'm not sticking around to find out .
