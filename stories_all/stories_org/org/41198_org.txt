the brown family held their annual reunion at the amusement park . the picnic was fun for all ages !
along the midway , there were so many games to play and goodies to eat .
grandma and aunt [ female ] went everywhere [ male ] wanted to go -- what good sports !
this roller coaster was very popular , but it 's much too high for me .
i thought this one would be more relaxing , but it had some scary <unk> and turns that surprised me . still , i loved it !
