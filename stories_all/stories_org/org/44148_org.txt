i went to the <unk> to see all the old <unk> they have on display .
you can really see how much emergency vehicles have changed .
even the <unk> and symbols have changed <unk> .
this is a very early example that i quite enjoyed for it 's simplicity .
here was the oldest , and my most favorite , vehicle in the exhibit .
