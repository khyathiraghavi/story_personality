we rode in to town on the <unk> , no <unk> , no mess .
our dogs were with us , tired after a long day of sleeping , apparently .
we took a few hours to see some star wars <unk> , as pictured here .
the family ! it was almost night by now , but the <unk> lights were strong .
the harvest moon ... the perfect sight on which to end the most beautiful day .
