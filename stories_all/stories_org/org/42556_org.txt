my grandfather was taking my sister and i on a bike ride along the river .
there was a <unk> <unk> along . it was an amazing site .
we tried to feed some ducks along the way , however , none of them wanted a bite .
it started to look a little <unk> out . good thing we were passing by the church , meaning we were almost home .
i 'm so glad my grandfather took us for this experience . it was great !
