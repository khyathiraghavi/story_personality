i had a great christmas this year . mom and location made sure i woke up to what seemed to me , the most perfect tree !
as i came running down the stairs i could see my stocking had fallen from it 's spot i had taped it to on our fake <unk> and gotten filled with many special goodies .
almost all of the toys i had on my list now lie underneath our <unk> tree .
my dog buster did not seem to care and was quite bored by the whole scene .
so , what else could i do but put him to work and have him give me office chair rides on the patio ice ? now how to get him to agree and not have to drop my hockey stick is another thing <unk> .
