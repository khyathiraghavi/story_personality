the sunrise this morning at our vacation house was spectacular .
a single bird <unk> above the water .
we had our traditional coffee and hot crossed <unk> breakfast .
punk , our dog , was eager for the day to get started .
we had a very hearty supper that night -- <unk> , mashed potatoes with <unk> cream and corn on the cob .
