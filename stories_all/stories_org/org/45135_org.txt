the final out for our side on the <unk> inning . tie ball game . this is n't good .
here comes the pitch ... a swing and a miss ! struck out !
with a time game , we head into the bottom of the <unk> .
their first time up , our pitcher throws and ... .
a line drive ! not an <unk> start to the inning .
