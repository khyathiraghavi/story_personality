we went out for a charity dinner with some of our friends .
we had great conversation over some pretty good food and of course lots of wine .
then they had a <unk> pool tournament where 50 % went to charity , 50 % went to the winner .
as decoration they handed out hawaiian necklaces .
it was nice to see so many people getting together . even made a few new friends .
