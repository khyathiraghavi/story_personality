we drove to the park and ride to take the train to the shore .
the train was on time , as usual .
the shore was peaceful , and the mountains were still <unk> .
several boats were in the water , that was surprising in the cool air .
more boats were <unk> at the shore , waiting there for their owners to take them back out to the sea .
