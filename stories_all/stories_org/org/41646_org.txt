unfortunately , my uncle [ male ] had passed away . he was a marine for the united states .
a few marines salute my uncle 's grave . it was very solemn .
they held a small parade in his honor . lots of people were in attendance .
there was a silent prayer being said . it was very beautiful , and brought me to tears .
here are some of the junior members for the local marine <unk> . they looked very dapper .
