we all came downtown by bicycle and met on the corner .
we would have came by stretch <unk> , but we were poor and could n't afford the gas .
by going to the cafeteria we could afford some energy food for ourselves though .
a little taco and a little organization and we were good to go .
it was a good night but we had a long ride home .
