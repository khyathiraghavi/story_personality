i went on a tour of famous stained glass windows at a very old church .
the windows were really beautiful and colorful .
the window behind the <unk> was very large and depicted scenes of christ 's birth .
on my way back to my hotel , i walked through the cemetery of the church .
i thought about everything i had seen that day and could n't wait to get back to look at my pictures .
