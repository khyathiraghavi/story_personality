as we approach the city , we got to see what a beautiful skyline it has .
the city was very active . we <unk> two kids having lots of fun a cart of some sort .
headed downtown it was very crowded . everyone wanted to see the firework show .
the fireworks were worth the wait . they were magnificent .
as we were leaving that night , we got one more glance at the beautiful skyline at night .
