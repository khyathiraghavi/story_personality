this is my brothers new house we went to visit and bring a house warming gift .
the side yard had a lot of plants and bushes with a bunch of trees .
a side view of the house you can catch the <unk> was so beautiful there .
my brothers wife loves plants and has a small patio garden near the back door .
here is another patio which would be great for bbq 's and other gatherings .
