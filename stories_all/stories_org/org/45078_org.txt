my town celebrates earth day every first of [ female ] .
the first of [ female ] used to be called [ female ] day and celebrated the spring time and the arrival of [ female ] .
our town just bought this truck for carrying <unk> to the <unk> center .
the young people really enjoyed the songs about saving the location and <unk> .
most of the songs did not <unk> , but everyone was very enthusiastic .
