our home , after we cleaned the all the debris up .
this is my neighbor 's home and what it looked like after the tornado . they were lucky .
this boat had to be tossed over twenty miles to land here .
that 's my friend 's car that 's sitting on top of my truck !
we were hit hard , but just down the street , our neighbors lost everything .
