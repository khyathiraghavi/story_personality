in my job as a tow truck driver , you see a lot of nasty <unk> .
here 's one i saw last night , involving a car hitting a motorcycle .
the car was n't even looking , and drove right over the cycle .
i could barely stand to look at the smashed helmets on the ground .
i <unk> away the car , while the driver of the car was taken away by the police .
