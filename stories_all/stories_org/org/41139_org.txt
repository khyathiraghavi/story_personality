it was christmas eve and we got the family into the car and headed over to the location location location .
an annual tradition , the location has to be seen to be believed .
thousands of lights are displayed while passengers in their cars drive through to see them .
my family likes to sing christmas carols as we drive through the amazing and festive holiday show .
this year , they even made a light display of an <unk> player . it was definitely a sight . we ca n't wait to go again next year .
