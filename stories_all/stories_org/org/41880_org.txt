another trip just when i was looking forward to relaxing at home .
i 'm flying into the dawn , but all i want to do is <unk> up and go back to bed .
touch down . why does everyone still <unk> ?
a <unk> is exactly what i did not need . we are already here . let us out .
the captain just announce we will need to sit here for three hours while they repair a <unk> issue .
