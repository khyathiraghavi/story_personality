this beautiful old village we visited last month truly seemed like a <unk> to human <unk> .
we could only guess as to the reason why so many homes lay in rubble .
still , life still found a way to <unk> in the <unk> conditions . it even <unk> on the <unk> !
fresh graffiti on the walls told a story of people <unk> and wanting their voices to be heard .
as we left we took note of vibrant life once again , as small children laughed and played in the street .
