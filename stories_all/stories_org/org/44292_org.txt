my journey through <unk> today was cool . i hit this cafe and had some alcoholic drinks at 10 <unk> .
i found some cool decorations on buildings . here 's a neat one i stumbled upon .
this guy was waving at me and so i waved back on my way through .
i found a nice clearing in a park where i took a nap for a few hours .
then i took a boat ride back home .
