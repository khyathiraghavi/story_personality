a marine laid a <unk> at a marine 's grave .
the honor guard stood by as one of the men from the organization unit paid his respects .
there were several people there to honor the marine .
all of the organization and the honor guard thanked each other for their service .
we should all take the time to thank our fallen soldiers for their service and pay our respects .
