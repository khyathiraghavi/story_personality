here we are , on one of the biggest <unk> in the country .
we took a bit of a trip with our tour guide to this gorgeous field .
soon , we were seeing all the <unk> architecture and churches in location .
we were so scared when we saw this one , we thought it was human !
we turned in for the night not too long after that .
