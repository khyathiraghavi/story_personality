the gathering was a very comfortable time .
we all ate a lot of food , and cake got eaten real fast .
the weather was beautiful and the water seemed inviting , but no one went swimming .
after enjoying everyone 's company for so long we all bonded .
if only we had a boat , we would have loved to take one of these out !
