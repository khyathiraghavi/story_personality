the young couple took a hike to view the old stone houses in the woods .
the scenery was very relaxing with a gently flowing river .
the woman was fascinated reading about the history of the buildings .
a picturesque bridge allowed the travelers to cross the river .
all this hiking makes a girl hungry and the orange tasted great .
