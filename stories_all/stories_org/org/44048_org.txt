we had a great trip . one of the first things we did was ride this hanging <unk> train . the view was stunning .
we also were able to make it to the baseball park . it was a great night for baseball .
the town was charming , with street cars that still carried passengers to the attractions .
we even got out to the lake , which was quite busy for the season .
one of our last stops was location location location location . the scenery here was beautiful . it was really a wonderful trip .
