i love old houses , but this one reminds me of the house out of organization organization organization .
the gingerbread <unk> on this one is awesome .
the corner tower on this one would neat from the inside . three story <unk> it .
this house would be fantastic if someone would fix it up . needs lots of <unk> .
this looks like it was a church at one time . all that antique furniture would look good in my house .
