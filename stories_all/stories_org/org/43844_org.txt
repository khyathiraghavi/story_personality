today we visited the botanical garden . the building is quite and the entrance is surprisingly ordered and formal in its presentation .
these yellow flowers remind me of some in my grandmother 's yard .
winter <unk> is pictured here . what a neat name for a plant with such interesting blooms .
i especially liked these miniature trees . they look like they were pulled straight out of a forest .
we visited the botanical garden at just the right time to see all of these lovely blooms . the greenery and color was very <unk> today .
