the house was decorated and ready for the holidays .
we had a bit of a mess to clean up after wrapping gifts .
we were tired , though , so we decided to rest on the couch first .
afterwards , everyone helped out making dinner .
once dinner was over , we all got to work cleaning up the mess we had made .
