i was out driving yesterday and i got stuck in traffic because of a huge accident .
the whole road was blocked off while they cleaned it up .
they had all kinds of equipment there to move debris .
we were all stuck there for hours until they were able to clear enough of the debris to let traffic flow .
eventually everything was cleared out of the way and normal traffic <unk> .
