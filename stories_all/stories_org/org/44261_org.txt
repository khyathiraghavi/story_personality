location gras for local residents of my <unk> encourage young and old alike to come <unk> went to the local senior center .
we all had the option to wear masks and <unk> choose to as it gives especially the setting and mood i think .
this was <unk> on our school doors , but flyers were sent home with interested individuals .
small potluck of different foods maybe experience at real mardi gras .
everyone had a chance to learn a song and dance to the <unk> is a lot harder then it looks playing an instrument .
