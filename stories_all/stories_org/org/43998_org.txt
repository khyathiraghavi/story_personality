we visited one of the newly built homes and it had both <unk> and <unk> .
the living room was very well decorated with plenty of light coming through the <unk> windows .
the nearby family room had a modern fireplace and tv <unk> but the <unk> seemed off .
and the basement was not completed .
finally the neighboring lots are still empty creating a feeling of <unk> .
