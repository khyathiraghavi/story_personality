grandpa did some adjustments on ours bikes before we headed out on our long bike ride .
we went all around the countryside stopping many times to enjoy the scenery .
we enjoyed the <unk> trail .
once my bike got caught up in some tree branches we knew it was time to head back .
grandpa was waiting for our return , he made us a nice dinner .
