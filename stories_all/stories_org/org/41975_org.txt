my first plane ride and i had to pick a small plane .
the pilot tells me it is very safe but i 'm not convinced .
we are ready for take off and all i can do is shut my eyes .
[ male ] finally got me to open my eyes and the view was amazing .
the flight turned out fine but i was so happy to get my feet back on solid ground .
