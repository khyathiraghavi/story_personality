the race in town was cool , as you could use any means you wanted to try to get to the end , and we used a bike .
we laughed as our little brother was unable to get over the red bar , and had to carry his bike .
but then we tried , and we could n't get over the bar either .
everyone was having a hard time , like this little guy who fell down .
old mr. <unk> won , with his sitting down skis !
