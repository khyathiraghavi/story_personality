yep , diving for the ball is a good way of playing to show any scouts out there that i play to win .
i also want to show them that i am a good <unk> .
and of course i must show them that i can slide into any base .
although , sometimes it seems that i am afraid of the ball , but be assured that i am not !
look at me go , i can connect the bat to the ball every time i at bat . go me !
