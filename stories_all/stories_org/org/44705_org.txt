my family and i live on a farm , so when i took my first plane ride to the big city , i was so excited .
the first thing we did after checking into our hotel was take a long boat ride on the river that winds around the downtown area .
that night we attended a baseball game , my first major league game . i ate 3 hotdogs .
the next day we visited city hall and learned a lot about the history of the great city .
for me the highlight was when my dad arranged for us to take a helicopter ride at night . so cool !
