i love the french fries and chicken at the carnival .
the ferris wheel is one of my favorite rides though i 'm still afraid of heights .
my and my <unk> [ female ] went around and took a lot of pictures .
the only thing i do n't like are the carnival games because i 'm very bad at them .
we took a last selfie in our hotel room . ca n't wait to go back to the carnival tomorrow !
