the guests all arrived for the backyard party we were throwing . one of them brought his <unk> he just bought .
we greeted the guests as they came on in , and caught up with each other as the night went on .
our friend brought his new puppy and we all played <unk> with a ball that he brought .
the guys were hanging out and chatting with each other about the latest work projects .
this turned out to be a really fun and enjoyable picnic for all our close friends .
