it is a rainy and <unk> day . the car begins to operate slowly .
we pull over to investigate . this is not good .
it appears that there was a collision . lots of things are on the front of the car .
the tire looks bad . we must have hit something big .
the tire seems like it is <unk> . this day is not very fun .
