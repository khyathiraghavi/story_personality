a couple spent a day and night in a snowy cabin getaway .
they rose early in the morning to watch the sun come up .
as it did , they found a nearby bench that demonstrated the <unk> , quite calm of the morning .
they noticed that frost had <unk> from the <unk> on the woman 's hair and <unk> .
as they watched the sun set again , they marveled at how wonderful their day had been .
