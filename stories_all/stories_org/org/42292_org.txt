my brothers and i went to the beach for a week and stayed in a very tiny house .
it was tiny , but there was still room when our parents showed up and surprised us .
even though the house was tiny , the beach beach seemed endless .
the row of tiny houses , like the one we stayed in , seemed endless , too .
can you believe all these people stayed in tiny beach house on the day it rained ?
