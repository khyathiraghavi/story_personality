this easter we invited the whole family over for supper .
i got out and fired up the grill first thing that morning .
i slow roasted a large roast to make sure it was good and tender .
then me , the wife , and our daughter got dressed up nice .
it was so wonderful seeing everyone and gathering around the table to enjoy the delicious meal .
