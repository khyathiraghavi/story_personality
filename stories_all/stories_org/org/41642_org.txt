i knew i needed to pace myself during the race so i stayed mid pack for most of the way .
i wanted to use this bike , but i won a few races with it already . it 's time to <unk> it .
it was a tough and long race but i made it to the finish line , and was the first one to do so .
they congratulated me with a trophy , flowers , and a check .
i was beat and i needed to get back home . i strapped my backup bikes to the roof of my car and went on my way
