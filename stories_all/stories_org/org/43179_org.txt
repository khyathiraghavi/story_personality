after the long hours on the road , we needed gas and something to eat so we pulled into this brightly lit service station .
the menu options for meal were almost overwhelming .
i decided to order the chicken soup with rice noodles .
for dessert and ice cream cone was very refreshing .
we nearly forgot the gas after that delicious meal .
