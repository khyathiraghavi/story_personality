this is the front of a very old building , looks like it may be a museum .
once inside i realized it is a museum with so many interesting pieces of old tradition .
there were 3 floors and each of them with themes of all kinds of cultures .
this piece has a very egyptian vibe to it , its powerful .
this one has a very <unk> greek feel to it and is equally beautiful to the rest .
