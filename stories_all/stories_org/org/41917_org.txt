it was the day of my wedding and time to say my vows .
after we had said our vows it was time to pray before we ate dinner .
dinner was at sunset , and the view was amazing .
we left for our honeymoon just as the last of the light was leaving .
we were so happy to make it to the hotel , ask we wanted was sleep .
