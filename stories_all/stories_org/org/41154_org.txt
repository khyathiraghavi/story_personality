our favorite time of the year , family vacation at the amusement parks !
here are some family members ready to go up in the air and come flying back down ! do n't get scared .
it was an awesome ride and great view . i 'm afraid of heights until after i ride a few rides .
here are some of the kids playing games . i wonder who will win .
the girls would rather play <unk> a <unk> . they are ready to go .
