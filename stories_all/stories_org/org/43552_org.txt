the tour of the historic village started with a look at a large , perfectly restored <unk> house .
the next home had a lovely tree and bench to rest outside .
one person could n't resist <unk> in the nice space .
the steel gray blue home of [ male ] <unk> was also on the tour .
my favorite detail from the tour were beautifully crafted doors that looked almost like a valentine .
