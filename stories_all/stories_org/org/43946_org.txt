after a big sunday breakfast , i walk to church .
to get there , i walk over the <unk> bridge .
i try to get there early to enjoy the beauty of the stain glass windows while the church is quiet .
once more people arrive , the church service starts and all the people pay attention .
i think even the statues in the church pay attention to the sermon .
