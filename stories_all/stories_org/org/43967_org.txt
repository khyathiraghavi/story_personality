the snow falls quite deeply around here , <unk> the flowers .
some grass are too tall and would stick out of the snow .
near the house , it can sometimes be a feet deep . i 'd then have to shovel the snow from the driveway .
it would slowly melt , revealing the dead grass underneath .
when it starts melting , the gulls would come back .
