we were very excited to be visiting location on our trip .
the architecture was absolutely stunning throughout the city .
we stopped by the pier and watched the fish swimming below for awhile .
we went to a local cafe to get some food since everyone was hungry .
everybody loved the trip , we are excited to come back next year .
