our trip here was an eye <unk> to how different the world really is .
the buildings had <unk> roofs and dirt floors .
the trees were beautiful now because of the fall colors .
looking out the doors of some of these house were so peaceful .
we all started to head out to our next destination at the end of a beautiful day .
