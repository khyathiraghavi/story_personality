i am preparing for my camping trip . first , i air out the tents in my backyard .
everything is cool . i am ready to go .
my buddies and i walk up the trail . it is quite a hike and after a few hours , you get really tired .
the journey continues as we climb higher and higher .
we make it to the top !
