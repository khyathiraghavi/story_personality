it was fascinating just to watch the ocean . the tide came in .
and later , we watched the tide go out again .
it was so sunny that we did n't notice , at first , how chilly it was !
after a while we headed back to the beach house to warm up .
that afternoon we played pool with [ male ] and [ female ] -- they 're great !
