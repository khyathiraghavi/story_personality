on my last trip downtown i decided to check out that big new sculpture in the plaza .
it is so shiny that it 's like a mirror . you can actually check your makeup in it .
i heard that the <unk> lived in an artsy neighbor nearby and had small sculptures in her yard , so i walked around a bit looking for it .
but all i found were houses that made me think of <unk> holes .
and , one house that was kind of <unk> . but , no sculptures in any yards .
