my first motorcycle trip took me through location .
i went through a town that was having a celebration for the holiday weekend .
it got too out of hand and the fire department was called to clear the streets .
i took that as my <unk> to head out and go back to the <unk> .
where i met up with my fellow bikers to plan our next road trip .
