we are checking out the lodge to decide if we should have our family reunion here .
it seems to have a lot of space and place for the kids to run .
the <unk> are nice and big .
i love the look of the lodge , but the thing that finally decided it for us was the view of the lake .
it is a gorgeous place and we are definitely having our family reunion here .
