the birthday boy wanted to greet his guests when they arrived .
we let him enjoy this gift a little early to keep him occupied .
the balloons turned out to be his favorite thing !
a nice family photo . too bad birthday boy did n't look at the camera .
he got a little <unk> and <unk> ended the festivities .
