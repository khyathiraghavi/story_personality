on vacation i could n't help wondering where all the people were because it was a <unk> street .
i walked up upon a large massive ferris wheel and i have to admit i just wanted to sit high on it .
i noticed when i walked up to it that it was <unk> the wheel of location .
i continued on my trip and <unk> a very great picture of a dome room on top a chapel .
at the end of the day i needed to spend the time to over look everything on top of the roof tops .
