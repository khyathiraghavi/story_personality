its my <unk> birthday and look at the beautiful cake they gave me with my name and everything .
i made a wish and blew out the candles like they wanted even though i got a little embarrassed when they all sang happy birthday to me .
imagine my surprise when i opened my birthday present and got just what i wished for .
i was so happy that i just ignored every body in the room once i got my hands on that guitar .
i am still learning on the guitar but this made my <unk> birthday the most memorable ever and i could not feel more blessed to have loved ones who would do this for me .
