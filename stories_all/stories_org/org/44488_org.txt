i saw [ female ] the <unk> at a theme park in location .
we visited during christmas and the decorations were so colorful .
i loved the classic look of some of the attraction , especially the retro <unk> mouse .
the water show was stunning with lots of colors and people dancing .
but the best attraction by far was the castle . it looked like a <unk> drawing come to life .
