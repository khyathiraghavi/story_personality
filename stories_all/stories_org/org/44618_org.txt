i 've heard ancient stories of secret <unk> through these <unk> rock areas .
some old writing within the moss , maybe it 's a clue or <unk> to enter .
the clue told me to push the green brick to enter a special <unk> .
i pushed the brick and it opened to these old <unk> stairs , i 'll follow them .
it lead me to this sacred burial ground , it 's full of treasures and <unk> beyond your imagination .
