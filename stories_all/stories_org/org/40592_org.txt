one sunday , my friends and i decided to go to the boardwalk .
we saw the original [ male ] 's famous , and stood in line for a hot dog .
we sat around after eating our hot dogs to allow our food to <unk> .
over to the side there was a volleyball match going on , which we enjoyed .
finally , we wandered off down the street to see what else there was around .
