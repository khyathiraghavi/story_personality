this was grandpa driving up to get me to go to the carnival . i was n't very excited to be honest .
it was almost dark when we got there . there were so many cool lights all over the place .
this was my favorite display of lights . i could stand under it and look up and imagine i was in huge arm <unk> of lights hugging me .
as it got darker the lights looked even cooler . this was the back of a building . i hung out here most of the night to escape my family .
a selfie of me in the dark . this one really captures my mood . hiding behind the colorful building in the dark . i ca n't wait to go home .
