my friend [ male ] and i visited the shoreline at sunset one day .
we walked along the beach and looked out over the water .
[ male ] perched on a rock and <unk> the <unk> of life .
the sun slowly went down over the water , <unk> gorgeous light over the sea .
finally , the sun <unk> behind the horizon and our day there was done .
