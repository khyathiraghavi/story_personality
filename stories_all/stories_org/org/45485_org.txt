decided to take the team out for a pizza dinner and talk about the up coming game .
for a while things got a bit <unk> had to tackle some short <unk> of each player .
with much understanding everyone realized that its only to help the team .
we expressed our concerns and what we should be doing as a whole team .
but overall we had a good time and ate some great pizza
