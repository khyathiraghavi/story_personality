small coastal towns have a lot of beauty if you look closely .
the homes here are more <unk> in size .
rock formations are <unk> along the coastline . they are visually appealing , but make swimming dangerous .
though it was a cloudy day , we still got a lot of nice pictures .
it 's so relaxing to sit on the park bench and look out over the water .
