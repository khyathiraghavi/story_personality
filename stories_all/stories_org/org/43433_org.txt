i went to my very first live concert today !
it was an amazing experience to hear all the instruments <unk> through your body .
the people there were really cool and they all enjoyed the same music .
the lead vocalist was amazing live ! it sounded just like the cd !
now to cross that off the bucket list . here 's to a great future !
