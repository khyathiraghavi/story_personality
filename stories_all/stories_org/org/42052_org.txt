my hike through the woods to the beach was exciting
there was one big tree that really caught my eye .
looking up , i saw the branches spread so i could hardly see the sky .
at first when i got to the beach the sky was gray and cloudy .
later the sun came out and the colors of the sky , land , and sea were beautiful !
