on our trip , we saw an abandoned area of the city .
no one lived here as the buildings had been damaged by an earthquake .
weeds were growing on the roof of one of the empty buildings .
some structures had been <unk> by graffiti .
rubble and trash in the street made the area appear even more desolate .
