this <unk> loves to <unk> about the people she turns into statues .
this is a man she turned into a lion because he was rude to her .
here are a couple of men who laughed at her , so she turned them into stone cats .
her favorite one was turning her lazy dad into a bear while he watched tv .
i realized why she brought me to see this . she waved her hand to say goodbye and i was frozen in place forever .
