finally , the day came for the concert of one of my favorite bands .
we all packed the stage as we waited for the stage to come alive .
an opening act came on first , which got the crowd pumped for the evening .
as the lights changed , we all knew who was up next : the musician we 've been waiting for .
the musician brought down the house as everyone danced and had a great time .
