everyone said that when we were in location , we had to go by [ female ] park .
so we did , and man , is location location location weird . the gate itself is enough to freak you out .
but once you get through , it 's a great park .
and even though it 's in location . it reminds me of parks in the location .
actually though i was kinda glad to get out of there and take a walk down by the pier to chill out .
