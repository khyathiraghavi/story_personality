we were all at the beach getting ready for a lovely day of fun !
first , we made beautiful heart shaped <unk> .
[ male ] threw a rock into the water because he was so hungry for <unk> .
he was tired of waiting , so he asked all of us if we wanted to go into the water .
we all took our shoes off , and then we <unk> into the water until the <unk> were ready to eat .
