on our nature walk we explored nature on a wooden bridge .
the beautiful greenery covered a bright sunshine .
fences had <unk> growing up them , and were noticed surrounding the park .
we had treasures to take home from our nature walk .
i picked some plants to bring home and place in to my garden .
