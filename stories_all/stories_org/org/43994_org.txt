many bikers enjoyed parking their bikes to go to the beach .
before they would head out they made sure they had a hotel to put their stuff in .
once they were back at the beach they checked out all the nearby beach houses .
heading over to the beach they would see all kinds of people walking even cowboys .
the best part of the beach was walking on the old bridge that was made of broken up cement .
