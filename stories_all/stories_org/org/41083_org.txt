i went for a charity swim on the beach today with my daughter .
the water was extremely cold .
my daughter took a picture of me because i look so much taller then everyone else on the beach .
from where we 're standing on the beach , you can see the ferris wheel beautifully .
they gave us a shirt and certificate for diving into the cold water .
