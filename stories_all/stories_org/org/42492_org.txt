recently , i bought a restored muscle car .
i decided to take it on a road trip to see what it can do !
i took route <unk> , a big highway so i could really see how the car runs .
i drove for a while , and saw alot of amazing sights !
i decided to stop in location location . i parked by the golden gate bridge and decided to head back home .
