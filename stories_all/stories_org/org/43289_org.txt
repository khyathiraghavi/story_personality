i had a beautiful day on the beach yesterday with [ male ] . when we first left the parking lot , we could see seals in the distance on the beach . [ male ] caught this pic with his zoom lens .
in order to get to the beach we had to go through a bit of woods . we saw these beautiful flowers growing wild .
and this little animal ... though i 'm not sure what it is . leaves on the ground so close to the beach ... it 's kind of amazing the variety of vegetation in this area .
when we got down on the sand ourselves , we saw people playing and <unk> around on these huge boulders . really unique shapes . must 've been carved by the wind and water .
further down the beach , rocks formed an arch and were <unk> with the vegetation we had seen earlier in the woods . it was a cool place to get out of the sun .
