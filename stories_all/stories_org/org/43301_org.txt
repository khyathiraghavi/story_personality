we took a trip to the snowy mountains over my vacation .
the snow only covered part of the mountains while the other half was covered in dirty .
the snow was <unk> frozen solid and was very difficult to walk on .
i got a picture of my best friend sitting in the gravel before we departed .
the sunset on the mountains was the most breathtaking thing that i saw all day .
