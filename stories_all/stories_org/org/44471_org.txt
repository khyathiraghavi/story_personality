i love preparing for christmas with the kids !
we always make gingerbread houses . of course , there 's as much candy eaten as decorated with .
when the houses are done , the kids ask me to judge them . i always say they are all a tie .
everyone gets excited when we pulled out all the old decorations .
and of course , there 's going to meet location ! i am so glad all the kids still believe !
