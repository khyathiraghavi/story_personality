we drove up the driveway towards the english <unk> , our new summer home .
the <unk> is a big tan house with a white <unk> fence .
we were met outside by my uncle [ male ] and his husband [ male ] .
we went inside for refreshing drinks , and talked the night away .
but the whole time , we had no clue that there were two <unk> on the roof , <unk> on every word .
