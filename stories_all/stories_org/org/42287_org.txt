everyone at the camp gathered to find out what exciting activities we would do today .
we played in the sun with giant chess boards .
after chess , we cooled off with a swim in the lake .
riding horses was our afternoon activity , and it was fun .
at the end of the day , we relaxed with an ice cream treat .
