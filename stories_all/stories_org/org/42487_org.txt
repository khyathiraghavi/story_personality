the day started out a bit <unk> , everyone was a little confused .
they had a long cold journey ahead of them .
they had to walk a bit of a distance to get to their destination .
once there , everyone pretty much let loose and got comfortable .
the <unk> ` s started to set up their booth for a good time and good music .
