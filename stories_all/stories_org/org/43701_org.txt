we were so excited to be going on vacation in location .
when we arrived we drove to our village and admired the scenery .
we found our <unk> and decided we should explore before it got dark .
we traveled along a path through the village and looked in awe at the beauty of our surroundings .
location is a unique location to visit , the village we stayed at was amazing . i ca n't wait to return again next year .
