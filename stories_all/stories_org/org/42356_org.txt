the flowers grew at random along the side of the road and they were lovely but she knew that was the only thing pretty about this town .
it was a dirty , ugly place that was best <unk> .
cheap murals were on the side of a store advertising <unk> and shorts although there was n't a beach close by .
it was <unk> that one store which simply <unk> `` <unk> , `` was in reality a <unk> .
she did n't dare stop and <unk> to drive on the next town to get gas .
