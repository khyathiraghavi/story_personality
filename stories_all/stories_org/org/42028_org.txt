it was a snowy day , so we decided to go for a walk to a big open field .
once we were in the field , i pulled my daughter on a sled since the ground was completely flat .
we decided sledding was n't the best idea , so we made snow angels in the snow .
we started getting cold , so we walked back to our house .
we made it after a long walk , and then we went inside and had hot chocolate , and then we warmed up near a nice <unk> fire .
