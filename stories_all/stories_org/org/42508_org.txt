finally got myself that new bike i 've been wanting .
threw on a <unk> breaks to drop some <unk> .
nice fancy <unk> front group set <unk> like a dream . so much better than my last bike .
of course a nice machine like this should be kept indoors .
i would n't want it to get rained on or stolen during my morning coffee .
