as we arrived at the museum , i could n't help but be awed at the scale of the extraordinary architecture .
inside was cozy and crowded , with a sculpture pointing the way to the <unk> room .
my girlfriends and i <unk> <unk> at the <unk> , bronze <unk> , arms <unk> , and rocking his lack of <unk> .
we found the <unk> room , and found a skull that had a bigger <unk> than that girl in the tv show `` under the dome `` .
looking at the mural of the killing of the <unk> creature by the <unk> was an entertaining and exciting end to our museum visit .
