we saw some nice houses on the trip . we liked the porch on this one .
however , the porch on this one was all the way across and the flag was a nice touch .
this house seemed to be biggest and included a garage and <unk> suite .
this house had the nicest garage and included a possible rental apartment over the space .
this house had the best yard for playing and also had a nice porch .
