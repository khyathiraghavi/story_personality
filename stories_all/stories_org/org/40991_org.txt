i am a photographer that likes to show a different perspective of a familiar city .
while most cities have statues , this modern take of the happy face <unk> me .
from this perspective , the ferris wheel becomes an interesting monument reaching for the sky .
with this shot , i can imagine living in a <unk> city .
a moment of curiosity between a woman and her reflection .
