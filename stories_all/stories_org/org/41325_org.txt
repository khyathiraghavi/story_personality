nothing like a carnival on a beach , it is the most fun you could have .
when you are not at the carnival you might enjoy a walk on the beach .
a lot of people like riding the ferris wheel , it is one of the biggest attractions .
after the carnival on the beach you never know what to expect . maybe a wedding at a baseball game .
and to top the night off why not a couple mascots acting silly at the game .
