some people do n't see any beauty in an industrial city .
they say the street are bleak , and the cloud of <unk> always hangs over everything .
the area under the overpass does n't hold any magic for them .
but they do n't see the gorgeous bridge at the edge of town , or the lovely arches at the start of the bridge .
when my family gets together in my <unk> hometown , we all celebrate the hidden <unk> the town <unk> .
