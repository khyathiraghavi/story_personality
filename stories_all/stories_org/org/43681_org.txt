a wide <unk> rainbow <unk> over the city skyline .
the rainbow is still showing its array of colors .
the clouds have started to move away , but our rainbow is still there .
a close view shows bands of green , yellow and red <unk> the sky .
now gone , our city is wrapped around a nice warm day with no more rain .
