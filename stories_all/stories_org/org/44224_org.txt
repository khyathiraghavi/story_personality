the horse race was a few minutes away from starting .
each contestant was carrying their horses to the starting line .
the horses had <unk> <unk> , from the color of their hair
to their size and strength .
before the race started , i made a $ 200 bet with several of my friends that the horse with the # 7 tag will win .
