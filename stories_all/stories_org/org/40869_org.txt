it was a wonderful day for a winter hike in the woods with the kids .
as beginning hikers , the kids are making use of their walking sticks .
the little boy was having fun climbing around the <unk> trees .
at one point , the mother held out her hand with some seeds and caught a <unk> .
as the day got longer , the children grew tired and dad carried one of them on his back .
