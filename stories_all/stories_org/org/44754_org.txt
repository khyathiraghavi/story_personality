we traveled up river to see some of the abandoned buildings from centuries ago .
we could n't believe the architecture . it 's so much more impressive than modern buildings .
and the scale of the place was both immense and breathtaking .
there were monuments and relics everywhere .
and a couple of places were even fixed up and <unk> .
