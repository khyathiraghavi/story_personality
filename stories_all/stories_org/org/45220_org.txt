i love looking at the old family photos when i was just a little girl .
our family had their first family group picture in <unk> .
we had to pose for pictures when my parents were able to buy they 're first car .
we always took the opportunity to have a picture , even when <unk> outside .
now our family pictures have grown to over more than 25 people .
