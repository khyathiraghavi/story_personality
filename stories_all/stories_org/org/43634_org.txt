our honeymoon hotel had the most perfect intimate restaurant .
each evening we enjoyed different <unk> cocktails .
the appetizers were delicious and almost a meal in and of themselves .
the main <unk> were served as a piece of art would be displayed .
we managed to get a candid shot of the chef before we left .
