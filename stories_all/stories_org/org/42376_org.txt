on sunday morning , we head to the shores for a nice relaxing day .
i liked the fact that it was deserted on this beautiful sunday morning .
we stopped by for refreshments and admire the beautiful scenery .
as we were walking down , i noticed these beautiful seagulls , without them , it would n't feel at the shore
when dinner approached , we decided to try this city island dinner with fresh seafood .
