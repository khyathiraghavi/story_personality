our family always does a fireworks display for the 4th of july .
my brother shot one off of the balcony that nearly caught the house on fire .
we finally got the hang of it by the third shot fired .
they lit the sky up in magnificent beauty .
i had to be careful though because the fireworks were a bit <unk> and were not wanting to burn right all night long .
