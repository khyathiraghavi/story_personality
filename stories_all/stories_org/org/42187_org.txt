we went to the beach and snapped quite a few pictures , i loved this one of the water splashing against the rocks .
<unk> white water rapids were just calling out to us to kayak .
we saw this deer on our hiking path , it was very photogenic .
we were able to snap the perfect picture of this bird in the tree .
we found some <unk> goofing off in the water too .
