in location , things are so much older than in the location !
it 's a very common thing to find houses with dates like <unk> , or older .
there are little historic details everywhere , like this ancient graffiti !
the graveyard have graves that go back 1000 years .
the churches are full of details carved hundreds of years ago . i love seeing them .
