we got a lot of people out to help with the new <unk> on the farm .
the garden got some long needed attention .
[ male ] was good enough to water the vegetables .
as the day wound down we sat around a campfire and talked before dinner .
to thank everyone for coming out , we cooked some burgers on the grill and had drinks .
