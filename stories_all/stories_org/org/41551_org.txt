i had never been to an <unk> concert before , and i finally got my chance friday night .
dj <unk> was there and started everything off .
after his set , dj <unk> took over and really got the crowd going .
but everyone was waiting for dj <unk> who took the place by storm .
he was so good that i knew this would not be my last <unk> event by a <unk> .
