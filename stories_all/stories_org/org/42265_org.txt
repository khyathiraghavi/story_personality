we had all seen the pictures dad left behind . we had n't had the time to walk into location before , but my work trip gave us an opportunity .
i remember dad talking about location in the <unk> of ways . he certainly took a lot of pictures .
we saw a lot of graffiti when we came in , and we were sure to take a good <unk> of it .
dad had liked street art , but what he liked most of all was the water . we spent a lot of time taking pictures for <unk> .
location , after the street art and the water , really was a small town , unfortunately . i could n't see what he saw in it . i knew he 'd love the pictures though .
