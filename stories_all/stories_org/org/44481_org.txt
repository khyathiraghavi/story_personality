it is christmas time again and as you can see my beautiful daughter has been busy decorating the tree .
here is my little family all together for a group family christmas photograph to put in our album .
i always take a picture of my beautiful wife and two wonderful daughters during the christmas season .
it looks like i was good this year because location seems to have left me something under the tree and i always love my gifts no matter what they are .
my daughters are getting into action <unk> what we gave them for christmas and i sure hope i did good with my gift selection because i want to see some big smiles .
