i was n't happy about the <unk> tree my brother got for christmas .
at least the toy truck was n't made in some factory in location .
though the sight of the tree did n't please our dog . she just slept at its gaze .
i 'm not even sure why he got my nephew a book of <unk> , he does n't even like <unk> .
and now he 's crying outside . what a <unk> christmas .
