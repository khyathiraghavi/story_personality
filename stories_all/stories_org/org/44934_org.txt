my friends and i take an annual hiking trip , we 're packed up and ready .
we decided to race to the campground , so we split up into teams .
we are in third place , but it makes hiking to the campground very fun .
we all arrived at the campsite eventually , and were very hungry from the race .
night fell and everyone went to sleep besides [ male ] , he always stays up to drink by himself .
