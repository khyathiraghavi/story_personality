there was once a city that had been buried under snow for everyday and night for <unk> years .
from the <unk> to the city street , the <unk> cold surrounded the city .
finally the citizens of the city were <unk> , and decided to pray for the snow to melt .
the next morning , to their surprise they saw that the snow had begun to melt .
by the afternoon everyone was happily <unk> that all the snow had melted and everyone was free to roam the city once again .
