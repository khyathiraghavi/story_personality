the family had rich and varied history , and the baby was dressed in the fashion of the season .
she grew into a little girl , wearing a large bow that was in style at the time .
she was a little unsure of herself as she posed , careful not to move .
the family photos were very serious . photographers needed people to be very still or the images would blur .
the family grew and pictures became more candid as cameras were able to capture movement much faster , and the little girl had grown up .
