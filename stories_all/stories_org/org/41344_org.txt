the crisp fall night gives way to the bright lights of a carnival and the man and monkey who greet you at the gate .
two strong men in <unk> suits perform <unk> for the crowds .
visitors pack into small eating areas to warm up .
the performers however do n't seem to feel the cold as they go about their nights performing their practiced <unk> .
some of the people in attendance are difficult to place as actors in period clothing , guests wearing costumes , or victims of the carnival 's <unk> in time traveling . their good <unk> do n't leave you especially curious regardless .
