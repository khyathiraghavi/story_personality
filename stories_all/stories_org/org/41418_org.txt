we took a trip to visit the old fair grounds .
it was a little creepy walking around the abandoned bumper car track .
the child 's horse was left off to the side of a carousel .
this <unk> batman <unk> figure was still attached to the carousel .
wow , this trip was interesting and ended in an appropriate shot of the old ferris wheel in the <unk> .
