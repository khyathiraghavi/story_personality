we went for a girls day at the beach , first pick out the chairs .
it was quite as we arrived as we looked for a spot to set up .
slowly one by one we saw people come to the beach .
it was a fun day as the tourists began to fill the ocean side .
we gave up the chairs and wandered onto the sand to join in with the crowd . a good day was had by all .
