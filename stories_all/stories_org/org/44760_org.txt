we decided to visit the <unk> during the fall .
there was a castle nearby , we decided to take a look at it .
the path that we went to , was somewhat barren , but we managed .
this tree was particularly beautiful . we took many pictures around it .
this was the tallest mountain in the day , and i 'm glad to have visited it towards the end .
