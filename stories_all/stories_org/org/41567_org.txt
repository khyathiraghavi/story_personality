we had great fun on our walking tour around the city .
my husband loved this shot with the cityscape behind him .
the architecture here is wonderful and <unk> in the soft sunlight .
the lights at night turn the city into a fun colorful place .
the new architecture here is also a sight to see , with its great form and color .
