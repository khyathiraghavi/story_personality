it is christmas time and at my house `` i 'm the boss `` as the hat says and i really loved this gift .
dads always love gifts of a festive nature such as socks or <unk> with little candy <unk> and christmas pictures on them .
here are my kids opening presents left by location under the tree which i am sure will bring smiles and cheer .
our dog ranger even has his christmas <unk> on and seems to be getting in on the festivities going on here at the house on this christmas .
it seems like every christmas , now that video games are all the rage , that my son and a relative or friend spend hour after hour <unk> to the tv playing games but that is ok if it makes them happy on christmas .
