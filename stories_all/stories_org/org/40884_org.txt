everyone was really excited to go to location , location to see the next president 's <unk> speech .
after driving all day , they camped out on the great lawn outside the capital and spent hours killing time by playing games and chatting .
the lawn was crowded with so many people waiting anxiously .
everyone was really happy to be there even though they had to wait a long time .
as day turned to night , the moment finally arrived and everyone became alert as they were about to witness history .
