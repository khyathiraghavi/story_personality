the family was so happy , because they got to go on a trip to the beach !
they got the tent all set up so they would have shade from the sun .
then they sat down together to eat a delicious lunch .
after lunch , it was time to play in the ocean . the waves were so big .
they played so hard all day , having a great time in the sand and water . they were exhausted and fell asleep on the drive home .
