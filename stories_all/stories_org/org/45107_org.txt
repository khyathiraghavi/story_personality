today i went to an arts and crafts <unk> with my sister .
here she is checking out these hand <unk> baskets .
they had a lot of nice necklaces too but i pass on them .
these mystery boxes looked great so i went ahead and bought one .
inside were these cards i can pass out . i didnt feel it was worth it .
