we all needed a break from the stress of holidays and work , so my friends and i went out to the local bar .
i told my buddy a joke , but i do n't think he found it funny .
we were goofing around a lot !
the holiday decor was pretty neat , ribbons and lights .
after a few more beers , i think my jokes were going over better !
