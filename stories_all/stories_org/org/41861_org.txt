a road trip to the coast . what would we see ?
we saw <unk> near the road .
when we saw the light house we knew we were there .
the cliffs had <unk> over time into wonderful arches . you could walk right under them .
there was a cliff that had broken in half and now the water was between them . it was an amazing journey .
