we attended the local festivities and were treated to a lot of local color and <unk> .
this street performer captured our attention for a while .
the crowds loved this performer and took a lot of photos .
of course the festival would not have been complete without a <unk> hat .
no matter where you are you have to stop and admire the architecture .
