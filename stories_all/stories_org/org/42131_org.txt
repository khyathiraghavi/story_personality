i went for a walk on the boardwalk .
people in the area were very open about <unk> use and i was shocked .
when the sun began to set , many people started to <unk> hoop .
i decided to get a <unk> tattoo at a local shop .
i also bought a bikini from the local shop so i could have it for the next time i went to the beach .
