when you see the wall of fancy circles , you know you 're almost at the wild days celebration !
there 's some terrific acts on stage for free .
the cool part is that most of them are <unk> !
people dress up <unk> . it 's not really a 4th of july thing , but it 's held around that time , so there 's a lot of patriotic costumes .
the winner of the talent show get the big rose bouquet !
