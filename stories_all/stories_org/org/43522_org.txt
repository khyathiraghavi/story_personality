we were getting close . and , we knew in our hearts , we would find that gold .
we continued up the mountain , it seemed like days .
and , finally , we reached our camp .
we rested by the fire for the night because tomorrow was the start of our journey .
we were now gold <unk> and we would be living like them for the next six months .
