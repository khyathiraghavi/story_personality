when i arrived at the french city of <unk> , i went to the cafe first .
after drinking my coffee i looked around at the cool monuments .
the statues were weathered and old .
the park was lonely so i headed to the <unk> .
i saw the ships coming and going for about thirty minutes before i went back to my hotel , bored .
