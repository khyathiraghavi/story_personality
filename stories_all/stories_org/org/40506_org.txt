today my family wanted to play outside , the organization was broken and the hose outside provided us with a cooling mist .
my mom thought it was so cute when i ran around `` cooling `` everyone with the hose .
my dad and my mom move the couch outside so granny could sit . she could n't stand for long but she played with me as best as she could .
i love being outside . i especially love when my sis <unk> the swing for me !
after a long day we drove granny back to her own home , she was n't able to drive due to her bad knee ...
