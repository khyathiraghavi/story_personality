me and my buds couldnt wait to head off for our vacation .
it was my first time on a plane and seeing them take off was scary .
we set up a giant bonfire on the beach . it was a blast .
i had to dip my toes in the ocean , it looked so inviting .
here are my friends taking one last picture in front of the beautiful sunset .
