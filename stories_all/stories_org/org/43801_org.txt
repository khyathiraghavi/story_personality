this was my first time riding public transportation .
the line to get on the bus was extremely long , and seemed <unk> .
we had to wait for a train to pass at the railroad crossing .
the bus was not full currently , but with that line outside , i am sure that will change .
my son was literally falling asleep on the bus ride .
