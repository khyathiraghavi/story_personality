this is my city . it is beautiful and <unk> . it 's rainy from time to time , but we try to stay dry .
sometimes it <unk> so hard , that we need to wear a towel indoors . the rain <unk> from the ceilings at times , so it helps us cover our head from the <unk> that run off from the roof .
i remember when it all started . before the <unk> anniversary of our favorite television show spongebob <unk> , we decided to throw a party for us and the kids . unfortunately , this party would be our last .
<unk> and light trails began to <unk> the location . we ran into our quarters , and looked on the internet to see if we could find why this <unk> was <unk> in nature .
we realized it was caused by the local <unk> monk who was reading [ male ] potter books . he would <unk> a <unk> <unk> in order to <unk> himself from the <unk> . it worked , but this was the last time we would see him .
