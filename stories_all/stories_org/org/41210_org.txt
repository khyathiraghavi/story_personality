my trip to <unk> bay ! the weather was cloudy and <unk> yesterday .
walking around the large streets i came across this cool clock . it was so big .
i wandered into the town square . this is where i tried to take a selfie and slipped and fell on my butt . that woman with the umbrella laughed at me and <unk> .
i found a <unk> stand and bought 5 <unk> ! ! i did n't know where to put them ! !
after walking for 3 hours holding 5 <unk> i saw this really cool ferris wheel . i wanted to ride it but due to the weather it was shut down . i took my <unk> and went home .
