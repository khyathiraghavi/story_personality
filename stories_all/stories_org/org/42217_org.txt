a visit to the beach was just what i needed . the sound of the water against the shore was so soothing .
standing behind the trees made me feel like i was lost on an island .
[ male ] and [ male ] decided to get closer to the water to see how warm it was .
the water was just so beautiful . i 'd love to stay there forever .
the waves were so magnificent . i was in awe .
