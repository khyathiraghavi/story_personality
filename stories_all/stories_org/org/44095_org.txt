[ male ] called me and said to come to the <unk> because a van had hit his car .
from the side it did not look too bad .
his window was broken but nothing else seemed to be alright .
the door still opened ok so we thought , just maybe he could get away with just a new window .
when we closed the door though , and looked at it , we knew he would be lucky if all he needed was a new door .
