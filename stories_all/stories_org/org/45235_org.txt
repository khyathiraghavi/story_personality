today josh got his face painted . he was a cat .
[ male ] wanted to have his face painted too . so we made him a pink cat .
they both wanted to find eggs . so we hid all different colored eggs around the house .
[ female ] found two but was unhappy about the small hunting area so they all got dressed .
outside they went ! playing and finding eggs for the rest of the day .
