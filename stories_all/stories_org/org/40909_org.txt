we got to the stadium with tickets in hand ; we were excited .
there was quite a crowd outside that we had to get through .
our seats were high <unk> but at least we had a good view of the stadium .
the girls all got this great ice cream <unk> they had there .
and me and my girl had an amazing time watching the game even if they lost .
