the minister at our church had a very exciting announcement on sunday .
they were <unk> the old <unk> player with a band .
the band began to play up on the altar .
they sounded great and it really made a lot of people start singing the <unk> .
we were all very surprised when a person playing the <unk> joined in . overall , it was a great decision to replace the old <unk> player .
