i decided to go on an adventure to a city i had never been to before .
it was getting dark when i came into town and the city was brightly lit .
there were many strange <unk> sticking up from the ground in this city .
i must have arrived on an important day as there were fireworks .
the fireworks were actually pretty annoying . they were too loud and there was too much traffic when they stopped .
