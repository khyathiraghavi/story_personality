we arrived for the big bike race very early in the morning .
i had bought a new bike for the race . i did n't tell my wife how much it cost .
the race was challenging . the route was gorgeous , though .
i realized a little bit from the finish line that i was going to win .
the moment of getting my trophy was truly one of the best moments of my life .
