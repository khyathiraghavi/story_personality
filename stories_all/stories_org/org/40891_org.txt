i visited the public library with my dog today , on this beautiful sunny day .
my <unk> puppy is so cute and follows me around without a leash .
here she is learning to <unk> , with a stick that 's as long as her !
this <unk> game continued for the entire afternoon .
by evening , she was almost entirely pooped out , so we went back home .
