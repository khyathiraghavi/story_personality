in this city , there is a big contrast between the old and new buildings .
older office buildings and <unk> tended to be made of brick , and their windows were small .
the newer skyscrapers use a lot of glass and steel , and it 's interesting to see the <unk> of older buildings in their windows .
construction is going on all over the city . in a few years , the skyline will look very different .
this new building towers over its older neighbors -- there 's a great view from the upper floors !
