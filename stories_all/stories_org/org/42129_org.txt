i pulled off to the side of the road to take a few pictures of the view .
one of the pictures included this lovely seagull , completely by chance .
i had n't planned to go to the beach but could n't resist after seeing the <unk> blue water .
the beach trip paid off and i saw some incredibly interesting marine life .
my trip was <unk> even more after we visited the bar on the beach .
