we took our family vacation to location this year .
our hotel was located right at the beach .
we went to town to take in some of the local cuisine .
a folk singer <unk> us while we ate . he was quite good .
vacations are always too short . five days went by so quick . we enjoyed our trip and decided we will visit again .
