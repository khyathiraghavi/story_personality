the island looked majestic as we arrived by rented boat .
it hardly had anyone living in it but we did see a child playing by the beach as we arrived .
the resort we had booked was beautiful and did n't <unk> with the local area .
the beaches were almost deserted , so we got to spend a lot of relaxing time exploring it .
as the sunset , we knew that this was going to be a highlight of our trip .
