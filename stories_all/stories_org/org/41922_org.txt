the winter weekend getaway began with a trip up the <unk> .
we then traveled along a snowy road to get to the coast .
the coast was very quiet and <unk> at this time of the year .
however , that did n't stop us from viewing a beautiful sunset .
our final destination of the weekend was the underground caves .
