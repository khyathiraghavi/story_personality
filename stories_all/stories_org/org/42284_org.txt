my parents took us to the scottish coast for vacation this year .
it was crazy . not a mile from the water , there were sheep farms . how do they keep the sheep away from the water ?
the road signs were neat . they all appeared to be handmade rather than <unk> .
we followed one of the signs down to the beach , were we walked along the coast .
mom made me take this picture standing along the cliff line . it was a cool area .
