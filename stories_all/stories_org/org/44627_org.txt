the sun started finally <unk> after a few snowy winter days .
you could look out over the field and see the snow melting .
the mountain in the distant looked lush and green after the snow melted .
a fence still held some snow on top of it .
some areas of the ground were still covered in snow where the sun had n't shone on them yet .
