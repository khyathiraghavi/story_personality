the onlookers were lined up and watching . the first of the black african queens in the parade was coming down the street .
beforehand the ladies had a great time . they helped each other dress up and get ready for the parade .
this queen did n't look so happy or excited . she was playing the part well of a mean african queen .
the outfits all looked <unk> . and everyone was enjoying the parade .
the final queen was dressed in an extravagant red outfit . she waved and threw candy out to the kids watching .
