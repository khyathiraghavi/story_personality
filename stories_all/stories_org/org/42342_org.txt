my friend and i took a short road trip this weekend to see the scenery .
we found trees that had begun to change color and gorgeous leaves that had fallen .
i <unk> into a shallow stream and perched on a rock .
we saw a railroad bridge over a river .
we decided to follow the railroad for a few minutes , but turned back .
