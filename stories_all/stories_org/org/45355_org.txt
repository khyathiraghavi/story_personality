i love giving my time to help those who are in need .
i volunteer with my church to go into these neighborhoods and deliver things they need .
sometimes , it is as simple as a cup of water .
other times , it could be enough money to pay for a month 's rent .
no matter what it is , we are making a huge difference in their lives , and that is what <unk> .
