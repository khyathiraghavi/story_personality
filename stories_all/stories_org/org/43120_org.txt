i was walking around town and noticed a bunch of cats sitting near a shop .
i looked at the entrance and was drawn to it , being such a huge cat <unk> .
i went in and found so many neat and wonderful things there , including these <unk> with <unk> .
i also was able to look through a <unk> of colored stones and <unk> , and i picked a few out .
after buying a bag 's worth of craft supplies and <unk> , i went out of the store and went to the fruit market . it was a good day for shopping !
