i spent most of the summer training to become a chef .
based on the <unk> of the plates , i think i 'm doing a pretty good job .
making a good meal always start with picking the best , <unk> ingredients .
i bought many of my ingredients from the local organization organization .
my <unk> , chef <unk> , taught me so much in so little time .
