i was invited to see rain art at the craft center today .
the blue rays of water were moved around with electricity and <unk> . it was amazing .
i found a wall of eyes . it was rather creepy .
more rain art but this time it was displaying bodies inside it .
the last picture i took was of an alien rain body . it was so red and amazing . i never want to leave this amazing place .
