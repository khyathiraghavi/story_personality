every year , the <unk> came to visit us for a week during the summer .
<unk> had escaped from his aquarium and was sun bathing in the back yard !
[ male ] and [ female ] looked around the <unk> space , <unk> the centuries of family stories that flowed from these walls .
[ male ] grew nervous , unsure of which direction to take ; knowing he was getting later by the minute .
[ male ] <unk> as his mother insisted on snapping a photo in front of the airport doors . it was his first trip overseas , and it seemed she was just as excited !
