for our vacation in location we got to see many tall buildings .
we stopped off an a local pub a few times and enjoyed a couple of beers .
the country side was gorgeous with green grass and blue skies .
the menu at the restaurant we went to was hard to understand .
the next day we stopped by some boats and did some sailing .
