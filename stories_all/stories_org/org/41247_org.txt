i <unk> places from my childhood . like the bench that i sat on next to the beach as i listened to music .
there was the ferris wheel nearby , which i rode on so many times .
i next went down to the beach and got my feet wet .
i returned to the bench and watched the sun set over the city skyline .
i then went to work and started <unk> for a living .
