the mountains are cloudy and chilly looking .
the weather wo n't keep those seeking to enjoy what the mountains have to offer .
icy waters and snowy banks trail through the <unk> .
the view is chilly and clear , with a <unk> of ice <unk> covering most of the water .
even in more somber weather , the mountains are still <unk> of great beauty .
