the abandoned prison on the outside of town is still standing .
the methods use to keep the <unk> inside are still view able , like this <unk> windows .
even thought the prison was very tall , they even put <unk> wire on the roof to stop <unk> from jumping off .
the <unk> wire was super sharp , and a great <unk> .
<unk> would always think twice before trying to cross over this deadly wire .
