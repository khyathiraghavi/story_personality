we were very excited to join mom and dad on a family trip to location .
dad was very proud of his new souvenir t-shirt that he picked up .
it was a beautiful autumn day as we took a stroll by the water in the park .
the beautiful art and architecture was on full display on our autumn stroll .
we celebrated our adventure with a nice glass of wine at the end of the day .
