i went to see the clock big [ male ] on vacation .
the clock was massive and intricately detailed .
i also saw a statue that stood close to the clock .
to my disbelief there was a ferris wheel close to big [ male ] that people could ride .
i had to ride the ferris wheel before i left and it was every bit as fun as i 'd hoped it would be .
