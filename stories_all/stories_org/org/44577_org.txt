welcome to my hometown . allow me to show you around .
i remember always coming down to this christmas tree every year and everyone in town would help decorate it .
this is the general store .
i used to come here after school every single day . i do n't even remember where i got the money from .
waking up to go to church every sunday was always so annoying . that 's probably why i no longer go .
