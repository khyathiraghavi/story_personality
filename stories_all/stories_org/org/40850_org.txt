dad took our entire family to the beach for summer vacation .
we went sailing which was pretty cool .
mom was <unk> about how hungry she was and was super happy to reach the shore .
i thought she was going to catch and eat a seagull alive .
we ended up walking along the boardwalk to look for a place to eat .
