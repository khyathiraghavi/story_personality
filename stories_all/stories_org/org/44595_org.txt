we have a very old church near us that has beautiful stained glass windows .
these windows are so intricate , that they really are works of art .
and the sun coming in through them on sunday morning is beautiful .
the church has been here for decades and it is a part of the town 's history .
i hope it stays like this for future generations to see .
