we have always enjoyed travelling to far away places .
with so many opportunities to enjoy unique experiences .
many times , even the places we stayed provided new experiences , like sleeping in <unk> beds .
we also enjoyed staying in places where we were able to gather with other visitors and share stories .
with so many sites to see , it always seems like we have to leave far too soon .
