there was once a young man who decided to go to a local community concert .
he saw plenty of old people dancing and talking to the music , and just enjoying themselves .
he also saw <unk> blowing bubbles and drinking beer as they watched the entertainment .
he favorite performer was a young lady , who sand a song that reminded him of home .
however , the crowd favorite seemed to be the old man that rocked out to classic 80 's rock music .
