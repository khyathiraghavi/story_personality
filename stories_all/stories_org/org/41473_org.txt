new years again . i always get excited when i see the lights and explosions .
here is <unk> trying to take pictures of people . every year i try to tell him it is about the lights , but he never listens .
so much smoke from the explosions . we hear the fire trucks in the distance , but paid then no mind .
some the the fireworks did not even go higher than the buildings around us .
on of the rockets fell down and flew into this building . we had such a blast till the cops came .
