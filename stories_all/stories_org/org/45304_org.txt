look at the kids excited about he easter egg hunt .
a lot of families in the community got together to organize this event for the kids .
all the kids are in line , waiting to take off running in hopes of getting the best easter eggs .
this little girl looks like she hit the <unk> . a basket full of eggs , and a gift basket filled with goodies .
here are some of the neighborhood kids with their baskets . they had a really good time , but they 're all tuckered out . they used a lot of energy on the hunt for easter eggs .
