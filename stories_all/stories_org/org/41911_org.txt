my wife took a picture of our son and i standing near the beach at sunset .
before she could notice though i was taking pictures of her and our daughter together on the beach .
on our way to a restaurant for supper after the beach i catch <unk> leaning out the window .
finally we reach our destination and the only thing on my mine is the wonderful food .
there it is in all it 's glory ready for me to <unk> down and enjoy .
