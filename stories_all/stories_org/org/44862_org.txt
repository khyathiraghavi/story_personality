yarn comes in many different <unk> that help people be very creative with their creations .
my grandmother <unk> frequently and for the longest time she was the only person i knew who did this in my family .
when i went to college , i met a nice girl who <unk> to <unk> stress and make a little extra money on the side by making things for people .
i thought that was really cool and tried to learn to <unk> myself but i am super <unk> and didnt have the <unk> to keep it up .
i am always intrigued when i see yarn balls because there is mystery locked within them to what will <unk> from them from talented people .
