i went on a trip to the location and one of the first places the family visited was big [ male ] .
next to old [ male ] was a large statue . i could n't make out the writing , but the artistic work was impressive .
as we continued to make are way down the peer i could see a giant ferris <unk> the distance .
before reaching our hotel from the peer a double decker bus came screaming past us .
finally we arrived at the front of our hotel , it 's big red doors in full view .
