it was a beautiful day out , so i decided to spend it working in the garden !
first i tended to the trumpet flowers .
then i <unk> back the <unk> a little .
i <unk> some rocks next to the cliff , trying to make a rock wall . it turned out alright .
after a hard day 's work , i kicked my feet up and took a nap !
