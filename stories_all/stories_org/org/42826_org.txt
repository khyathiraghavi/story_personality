today was [ male ] 's birthday but he had completely forgotten .
we decided to wake him up so we could begin his special day .
i decided to check with [ female ] before [ male ] got around to the kitchen to make sure everything is ready .
he was so happy the moment he saw the cake , that he could n't wait to blow out the candles .
once he finished blowing out the candles we sent him outside to play with his friends in the <unk> castle we rented .
