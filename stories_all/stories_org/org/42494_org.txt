it was a beautiful saturday , so i hopped into my convertible for drive around the location location area .
once i made it to the location location location , i knew that i getting close to my ultimate destination .
i headed towards the <unk> south to find my favorite driving location .
finally , i was <unk> driving along the <unk> roads that followed the coastline .
at the end of the day , i stopped to take a photo of my favorite car with the city and bridge as a stunning backdrop .
