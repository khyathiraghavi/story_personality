i decided to throw myself a big party for my 30th birthday .
i arranged all the details with the restaurant manager . we went over the theme and found some stickers that would work for it .
i loved how the table looked as we prepared for guests .
the restaurant was just what i wanted -- <unk> but warm .
i had a lot of fun preparing the dessert tray , complete with some <unk> pies to celebrate my location heritage !
