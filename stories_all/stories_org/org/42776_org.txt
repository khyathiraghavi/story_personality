we were taken out for food and drinks by our friends and i should have known by the way they were acting that something was up .
drinks started to flow and things got a bit strange with the the food but it was all in good fun and we had a lot of fun .
they even made us wear these costume hats to be king and queen for the evening which i never saw coming .
i still do n't remember doing this with the tiara but i was having fun it looks like from the big beer <unk> smile on my face .
a couple that are our best friends even got in on the action and i am glad i was not the only one with the tiara on in a picture which i never will let him forget . ( let the good times roll ! )
