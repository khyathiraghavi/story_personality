i did not like my old church so i decided to attend a new one .
the preacher got up and gave the sermon was so much emotion , it is not what i am used to .
after the sermon all the <unk> began , this church had their very own band .
the way that they sing moved my soul .
i am so glad that i made the decision to <unk> churches .
