we toured location , location location on our recent vacation .
the scenery in the numerous parks was so calm and relaxing .
flowers were everywhere , even outside their churches .
the old architecture was fascinating to me .
but i was n't in shape to climb the stairs to the top of the clock tower ! i was ready to go home after that .
