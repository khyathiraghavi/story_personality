i have always lived <unk> during my younger years and have a <unk> for the sea now and i am fascinated by cottage style <unk> close to the ocean side .
i enjoy traveling around looking for where i would like to spend the rest of my days and i love to take pictures of the places i find the most appealing .
this house was one that i would have loved to buy if it had been for sale because i thought it was just perfect for me .
i found this home beautifully <unk> and just the perfect size for myself and what i have to fill it with but it is not available either .
i suppose i will keep on with my search to find that perfect cottage by the sea and to take pictures along my way of what might have been if the <unk> had been right .
