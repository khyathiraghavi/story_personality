it was a beautiful day so i decided to go for a walk .
i just wander the streets lost in my own thoughts .
before i knew it i seem to have gotten turned around .
i was passing <unk> i 'd never seen before , it was time to ask for directions home .
after adding two hours on to my walk i finally made it home exhausted and hungry .
