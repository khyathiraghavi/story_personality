to get the perfect flower picture this spring we went to the park .
the <unk> , <unk> , and reds , were beautiful , but not quite what we wanted .
we spent time in the gazebo and looked around for inspiration .
we found a <unk> statue that was just about the perfect color .
finally we found the orange and yellow hues we wanted and took our perfect flower picture .
