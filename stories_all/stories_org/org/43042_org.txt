as we were hiking on our trail , i could not help but take a picture of this gorgeous tree .
the way the ants <unk> the <unk> , it look like a <unk> of art .
this is a picture of my hiking partner walking across the bridge .
my friend was scared to take this picture , as she felt i could fall in the hole .
as we reached the end of the hike , we took a picture of our accomplishment .
