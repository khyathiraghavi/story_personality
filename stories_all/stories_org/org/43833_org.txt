i was happy to finally arrive in location for business plus vacation .
i found japanese traditional houses very unique .
i rented a car from the airport and drove to my hotel .
the hotel room was tiny but it had everything that i needed .
at the end of my trip , i went to visit a japanese family . they were my college friend 's relatives . it was fun to be able to meet a traditional japanese family .
