we arrived into town yesterday . i had never seen such efficient transportation !
our second night in , we caught a ball game .
we left our car at the hotel , and took the trolley around while in town .
our hotel overlooked the lake where everyday many people were boating or <unk> .
we planned to go to the location location , but did n't get around to it this time .
