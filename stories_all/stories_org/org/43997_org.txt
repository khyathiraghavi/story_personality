this nice couple was shopping for real estate .
the living room was well <unk> but a little hard to move around in .
the dining room had curtains that did n't match the living room .
the basement was <unk> finished , just perfect for a pool table .
it was out in the middle of nowhere , but maybe they would get lucky and gas prices would fall to record <unk> .
