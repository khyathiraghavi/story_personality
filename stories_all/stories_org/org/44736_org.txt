on a recent trip to location , the tourists saw many traditional chinese attractions , including this temple .
they were taken in some non traditional tours , such as through this river .
the river was very narrow is areas , with lots of vegetation .
there were trails to explore , and old , <unk> bridges to cross .
once they returned from the wilderness adventure , they had the opportunities to visit many more building and structures .
