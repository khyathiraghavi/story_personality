i came home to quite the surprise today for dinner ! my husband bought live lobster for supper .
they were cute , i named one <unk> .
my husbands favorite was named <unk> because he had weird green <unk> .
<unk> also had huge <unk> !
we put them all in a bowl to cook , but i could n't end up eating them .
