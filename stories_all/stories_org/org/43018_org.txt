it was great to gather the group together before the show .
the cast was fantastic , they made the scenes come to life .
when the show ended all of the actors gathered together to say farewell to the audience .
mom and i talked about our favorite scenes while we ate dinner after the show .
every thought the ending was quite hilarious .
