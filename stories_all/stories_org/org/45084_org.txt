when the parade started the crowd cheered , and others looked up in the sky to see what <unk> the cheer .
the wind took flight and there it was , the beautiful american flag .
an airplane flew over the flag bringing more attention to it .
as the parade carried on there came more beautiful flags on display .
and even more , as little men had their own little beautiful flags to <unk> around proudly .
