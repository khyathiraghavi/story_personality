an old church i wanted to take pictures of today . i really like the black & white photos .
the back of the church . this part was added on years later .
the main stained glass window in the church . looks creepy in the dark .
a whole other window in the daylight . not scary at all , kind of calming .
this is one of my favorite ones in the church .
