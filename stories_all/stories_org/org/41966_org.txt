my family is a bit strange in some ways but one thing we all like to do if fish and also catch crabs because we like to eat them .
there are lots of different ways to catch crab and normally i would not do it this <unk> way but it 's all we had and i did not have the <unk> for <unk> i usually use .
the <unk> <unk> does and did work and as you can see we caught some crabs to eat .
here is a better photograph of the bucket full of crabs and another creature or two if i remember right .
we all got tired and people started falling to sleep so we headed back home knowing that we would be back another day to catch more crab and next time we would be ready .
