we were hiking through the <unk> the other day .
while hiking through the <unk> we came upon a ridge .
after we crossed the ridge we were shocked to find a beach on the other side .
from the beach we spotted a huge rock <unk> out of the water .
we walked closer to the rock and was surprised at how big it really was up close .
