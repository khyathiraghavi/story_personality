here we are at the peaceful protest holding our brightly made signs .
there were just a few that did n't want to follow the peaceful rules that were made for this march .
the march has started and we are a determined <unk> .
the police are kept busy during the march making sure that it is kept peaceful .
it seems that more and more people keep showing up to show there support for this march and enjoy doing so .
