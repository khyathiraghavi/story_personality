in the winter , the town where i grew up was a place of wide snow covered roads and friendly people .
how well i remember the rides on my little sled pulled by mom on brilliant days .
with delight i 'd roll in the icy cold <unk> making snow angels .
then after a day of play in the cold fields , mom and i would <unk> back to town .
back in our warm house , mom would make hot chocolate with marshmallows to warm our <unk> , happy souls .
