our trip to the capital was fun but solemn , with so many new sights to see , but memorial day was a sad purpose .
there 's so much walking , so luckily the weather was good , but we thought we were in for a storm when the sky <unk> ,
so many people here -- maybe a holiday was n't the right time to do tours , but as long as we were there , we had to see all -- people protesting were an interesting backdrop , but i never did find out what that was about .
more walking , more clouds -- but still nice , so we headed out to see more of our history .
we were late for cherry blossoms , but there were still many beautiful trees that showed how carefully laid out the area was .
