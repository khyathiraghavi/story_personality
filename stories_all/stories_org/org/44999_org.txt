a crowd is gathered around the street to watch a small parade .
towards the middle of the parade are a group of bicyclists .
their bicycles look different than an <unk> bike .
some of them look normal but others are taller and longer than what you would expect .
leading up the end of the parade is a <unk> from a train with people on it .
