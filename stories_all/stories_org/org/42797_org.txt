that 's me on the left . my great day started with a visit to the beach with my parents .
that evening i attended an awards ceremony . those are my dear friends .
my parents came from location . they look nervous in this photo but they were very excited .
that 's me , just before i received my award . smiles all around .
now the hard part : that 's the master of ceremonies introducing me . i have to make a speech . i 'm ready !
