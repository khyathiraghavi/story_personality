hank was starting some home repairs that he 's put off for too long .
while working on the door frame , he noticed that his equipment was n't working properly .
he shook it and tried to fix it but nothing seemed to work .
he took a real close look and realized his mistake .
hank was holding it the wrong way and went back to working on the door .
