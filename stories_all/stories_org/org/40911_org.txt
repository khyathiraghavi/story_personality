this morning my sister and i decided to go on a bike trip to our favorite campground , on the way we rode past a flock of geese .
we rode past this town on our way and stopped to take a picture of it .
we stopped at a pick <unk> table at the campground and decided to have lunch .
we ate <unk> and cheese and a <unk> we 'd packed before we 'd left this morning .
after lunch we set up our tent and then went for a short hike .
