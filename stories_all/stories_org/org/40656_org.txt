before fixing a fire place 's <unk> you must have the right tools first .
then you need to inspect the fireplace in <unk> .
i start <unk> from the top of the fireplace because it is the most <unk> .
then i work my way during the inspection from the side of the fireplace down .
for this particular job , the problem lies at the bottom of the fireplace . this damage is due to the flames from the fireplace .
