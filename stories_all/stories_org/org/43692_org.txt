the family decided to drive to their <unk> 's house in location .
on our way to our parents house , we found a building with a <unk> fountain .
after passing through the city , we stumbled upon a house made out of <unk> .
as soon as we arrive to the central of the city , we realized we had been lost . the <unk> <unk> system sent us the wrong way .
once we found our way back , we decided to pass through a field of beautiful flowers .
