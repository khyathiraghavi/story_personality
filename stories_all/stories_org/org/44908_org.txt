for a celebration , we started with homemade food .
we continued with drinks at home , toasting each other .
after a while , we wanted something more , so we headed to the location <unk> .
there were so many flavors to choose from .
they were all very delicious , though , and we ate our dessert as we wrapped up our celebration .
