the beads <unk> with each step she took down the street
the little boy in his costume watch his mother while she talked to her <unk> .
the child looked at me with <unk> . i did not know how he saw me , but we met eyes none the less .
the drums played to the beat of the soul . i felt it deep inside of me while i watched the sticks pound the drums .
it was a lively day . the drummers played with such love for their craft that we all started dancing in the streets .
