last sunday , we all packed into the <unk> to go visit our local <unk> shop , uncle [ male ] 's flea market .
there were tons of treasures to dig through ! we went through the indoor portion , and then to the outdoor portion , which even had a bus full of items that you could walk through and shop for !
we each found something special to bring home . [ male ] found this great bike , for only $ 20 !
little [ female ] brought home this lamp . i tried to talk her into getting something else , since this lamp did n't have a <unk> , but she insisted that this was her treasure to bring home for the day !
but nobody had as special of a purchase as [ female ] , who bought a talking parrot ! now we have another <unk> family member to talk to on the weekends !
