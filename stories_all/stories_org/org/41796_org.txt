this community is has gone through some hard times .
they have hand built their homes with what little they had .
there schools were so empty that many <unk> could be put into one .
sometimes teachers would not even care about the money as long as they could <unk> the kids .
the kids taught today are the leaders of our future and they are happy with what they have .
