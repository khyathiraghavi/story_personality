the town of location in location location is a sleepy little town that has a unique claim to fame .
it is the home of the world 's largest living lit christmas tree .
i stayed in this bed and breakfast when i visited the town to see the tree lit in early <unk> .
the whole town gathered at this restaurant to have hot chocolate and cookies before the tree lighting ceremony .
after the tree was lit , those that wanted to could attend a christmas service in this small church .
