it was the holiday season , and a family decided to drive to see holiday lights .
on their drive , they passed by a couple of neighborhoods that were run down and full of graffiti .
they arrived at their destination to see the christmas lights .
after looking at a few homes , they felt <unk> about seeing the run down neighborhood and decided to do something about it .
they went to their local food bank and donated some food in the holiday spirit .
