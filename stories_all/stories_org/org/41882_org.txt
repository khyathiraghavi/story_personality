everything at the airport looked so busy that it made me even more nervous about my flight .
after <unk> , i felt better once i looked out my window and saw the beautiful view .
after landing , the sky was less attractive , a dreary gray having taken over .
things looked busy here too , but it did n't worry as much this time .
once outside the plane , it looked even less attractive , but it was the country i was excited for , not the airport .
