this is the view from our room of the early morning light <unk> through the fog .
some of the beautiful fall foliage right outside the place where we stayed .
once we 'd <unk> up for the morning , we went on our annual fall hike , these are some of the buildings near the area camp we started our hike from .
we passed a <unk> rail track that ran off into the distance .
driving around and walking around location location during the change of leaves can be nice , but it 's also best to keep your eyes on the road and not get in a wreck like these people did !
