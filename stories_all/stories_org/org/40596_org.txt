our first time playing at the club and it was packed .
our new lead singer knocked <unk> dead !
i do n't know who <unk> the parachute to the ceiling but it was awesome .
then it was my time to do a guitar solo . of course i picked <unk> ' <unk> location .
by the end of my solo my fingers were pretty much raw . and the crowd loved it !
