he woke up extra early that morning , for his first day of his new job .
he was very nervous , but could n't manage to wake up on his own .
he had a few <unk> on his way out .
he had dressed his best , but the coffee had kept him <unk> .
at his desk , he found that he had a lot of <unk> to fill out just for his first day . what a pain .
