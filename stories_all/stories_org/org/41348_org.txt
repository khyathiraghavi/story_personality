the first thing we did was take the train into the city and this is where we got off of the train .
this is the biggest ferris wheel any of us have ever seen !
here is a sign that gave us some information about the huge ferris wheel .
we especially loved this beautiful old bell tower .
the mixture of different architectural styles was really interesting here .
