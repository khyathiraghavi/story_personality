the road trip to the wedding my family went on was so long that my mom 's work , the library , actually took a group photo before we left .
the whole family came in two big <unk> <unk> .
we went to lots of state parks as we worked on our coast to coast drive .
when we got to the location location , we took small group photos to celebrate .
the wedding was beautiful but we did n't really want to get back in those <unk> !
