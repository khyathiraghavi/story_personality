a group from the local church gathered at the warehouse to see a concert .
the band was great ! everyone had a lot of fun .
the show was winding down and folks started to get ready to leave .
outside , they had a conversation about their favorite moments from the concert .
they ended with a religious service to thank the lord for their fun , blessed day .
