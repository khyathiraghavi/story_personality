in the ancient cemetery , the dead do n't speak but the moss tells a story of slow , calm life .
it covers the headstones of villagers past , <unk> to the <unk> letters .
the moss makes a soft carpet on the hard , ancient stones , like a welcome <unk> to this <unk> place .
wherever it can find a shady spot , it <unk> , like on the corners of this ancient staircase .
the moss has no <unk> for who 's graves it covers , and does not care how [ female ] died .
