the birthday celebration began with a group photo at the restaurant .
they brought out a cake for the birthday boy .
the next morning , it was time to head to the beach , but not before some coffee .
at the beach , everyone had a great time building sand castles .
that night , they did some night swinging . it was a new attraction at the beach , where you get swung through the air as a group by a long <unk> <unk> .
