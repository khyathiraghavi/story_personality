we arrived at our destination as the sun was going down . that was fine because we were pretty tired from the long trip .
after a good nights sleep we went exploring and came across a long the dock . we walked down the dock for a while .
when we came to the end we found ourselves on a rocky beach where we spent some time looking for crabs .
in the distance the clouds rolled in and we thought we would get caught in the rain .
fortunately , the clouds passed and we enjoyed the rest of our day at the <unk> .
