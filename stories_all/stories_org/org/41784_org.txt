we went to visit a quaint little log cabin .
the inside of the cabin was beautiful , made with light colored wood .
it was empty in all of the rooms we visited , but was still a beautiful cabin .
when leaving the cabin , we turned around to get one last good look .
after that , we drove to a nearby lake to enjoy the sight of the water .
