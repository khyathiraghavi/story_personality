we recently traveled to an abandoned carnival .
the bumper cars , long abandoned , have collected dust over time .
this giraffe speaks of an era long past .
batman is as popular today as he was long ago , although he has had a face lift .
one can only imagine the screaming , <unk> patrons of this abandoned carnival ride .
