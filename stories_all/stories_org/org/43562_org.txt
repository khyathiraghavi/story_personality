we saw some crazy sights on our trip . at this house , it appeared like a shark was flying through the roof .
the architecture was beautiful . this building was like a castle . it was definitely fit for royalty .
there were interesting statues as well , in surprising poses .
we were surprised to see this chalk board with <unk> problems .
it was a grand estate and we ca n't wait for you to see it one day .
