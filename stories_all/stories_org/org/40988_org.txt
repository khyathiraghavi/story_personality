we always enjoy a ball game at the field . nothing like a day in the sun watching the game .
my wife is a big fan of the mascot . they seemed to spend a lot of time together ...
but i got into the picture as well <unk> i 'm on the right . the tall guy is yet another mascot . my wife is a mascot <unk> !
the game was great . the kids had a fantastic time and our guys won . we always have a fun time cheering them on .
the other team did n't stick around after we won big ! maybe next time .
