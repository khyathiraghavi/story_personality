during the <unk> project , the first thing that had to be replaced was the engine .
after that , new control panels were added as well as a new <unk> board .
custom racing seats were ordered and when they arrived , the fit nicely .
finally , the new tires and <unk> were put on .
after all that hard work , the project was complete and the car was fully restored .
