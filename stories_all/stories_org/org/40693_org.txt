we spent the day driving through the mountains .
even when we got closer to them , they still looked far away !
we drove through location location and decided to stay there for the night .
our campsite did n't look like much , but at least we all got some sleep .
we were back on the road in the morning and , before i knew it , the mountains were far away again .
