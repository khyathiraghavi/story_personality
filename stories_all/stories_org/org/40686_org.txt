when we arrived to the fair this guy was the first thing we saw . a little creepy if i do say so myself .
[ male ] and i were very excited about the horse show at the fair today .
after the show we decided to walk around the animal sanctuary and ran into this cute guy .
there were so many beautiful flowers all around the fair .
it would n't be a day at the fair without crazy food options !
