we got into location on july 4th .
we had to ride these long <unk> to get to the exit .
some of the <unk> in the terminal caught our eye , in particular this one for the <unk> board ...
and this one advertising the beauty of location location .
as we left , these friendly police officers wished us a good vacation !
