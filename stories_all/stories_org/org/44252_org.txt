we were so excited to be on holiday that we started it off by dancing on the balcony of our hotel .
we rented a van so we could explore the streets of the town we were staying in .
the castle that we passed was gorgeous and majestic .
the buildings where the <unk> live are also very nice .
we are so <unk> with this town that we are thinking of getting an apartment in this building !
