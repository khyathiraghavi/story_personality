i bought an old house in the city , and went to look it over this weekend .
the building was in good shape , but there were a lot of signs of needed security <unk> .
the building was surrounded by a wall with barbed wire on top .
the wire was <unk> sharp , and was of the new type of wire .
this wire could keep anyone from getting in or out .
