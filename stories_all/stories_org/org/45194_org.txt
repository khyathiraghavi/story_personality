it was a bright sunny day at the park .
i was out and about , enjoying the clear air and weather .
i met up with two of my friends , we laughed at some of the pictures we took of wind toys .
here is one wind toy . it is a brightly colored flower .
here is another set of wind toys , set up to look like bike wheels . they are also brightly colored .
