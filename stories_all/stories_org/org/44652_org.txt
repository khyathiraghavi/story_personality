we decided to visit the town nearby , as we are in the market for a new house .
i loved this house , but i do not like corner lots , plus it was not for sale .
i like that the church is within the community .
in addition , the cemetery where my grandmother is buried , is located within the neighborhood as well .
my husband thought this was a house , but i had to let him know it was a tunnel .
