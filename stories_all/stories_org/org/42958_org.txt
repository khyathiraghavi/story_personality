my brother sat <unk> at my parents , ready for his gifts .
my mother made him read every card out loud !
he pretended to be thrilled with this travel mug but i know he has enough of those .
he was wondering if the family party was over so he could go drink with friends .
one last gift , brother , and you 'll soon be free of this <unk> party .
