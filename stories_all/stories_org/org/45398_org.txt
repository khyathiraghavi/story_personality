i 'm not a huge fan of <unk> meetings so i was n't too thrilled to see the rooms blocked off and a speaker when i came into work this morning .
and then the speaker started with a power point about being <unk> and i was just waiting for words like `` <unk> `` and `` think outside the box . ``
and , of course , we had to break into small groups to come up with ideas which is always awkward for me as i tend to be <unk> .
but i did enjoy the smaller session later in the day and the use of the wall as a projector .
i ended up having a good day because how can you not like an exercise that has you visually represent a classic saying !
