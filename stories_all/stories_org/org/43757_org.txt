elephants are probably my favorite animal when we visit <unk> zoo .
the giraffes are fun to feed . their long <unk> are blue and <unk> looking !
the pink flamingos are much more beautiful than their plastic <unk> . the way they stand on one leg makes me laugh .
the penguins keep coming right up to the glass of their enclosure . it 's as if they want you to take them <unk> .
my granddaughter 's favorite part is feeding the <unk> from her hand .
