they told me it was my day , they were taking me out for a good time and that i deserved it .
there is nothing like good <unk> , carnival style food and good entertainment to really lift a girl 's spirits .
i love animals and they knew i would just love the dog frisbee competition as part of the entertainment for the day .
i thought they might have forgotten but they really surprised me when we got home with a birthday cake just for me but of course i will share it .
this really was my day and i am so lucky to have such special family and friends to spend time with that would surprise me with this cake which is just so pretty to me that i had to take a good picture of it for my scrap book so i never forget it .
