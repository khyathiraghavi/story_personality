i love to visit the cathedral behind my house .
the cathedral <unk> some sort of box that i 'm told is empty , but i remain very curious .
<unk> , the cathedral burned to the ground last weekend .
one of the only things that survived the fire is this boat .
now , instead of visiting the cathedral , i spend my quiet times on a park bench .
