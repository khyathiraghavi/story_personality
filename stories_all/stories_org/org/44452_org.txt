we hit a crowd on are way to the market .
the crowd continued all the way to the entrance .
once inside we saw some funny thing like this person and their flower mask .
he did n't need the mask to sell this gorgeous flowers .
we found a less crowded section to take a breather . lots of other <unk> shoppers at a similar idea .
