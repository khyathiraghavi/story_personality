the family takes a vacation to the beautiful coast line .
the waves come in from the ocean and pound the shores .
watching a sunset from the beach is always a fantastic way to end the day .
then as darkness falls , the lights come on in the bay to celebrate .
all in all , this family had a great day at the coast .
