i once had a dream , my dream was to grow from a small little <unk> , to a big firework like my daddy .
then it actually happened ! this magical day in early july i got all packed up and sent out to do work !
i started as a dim red light , slowly glowing brighter and brighter . my friend rainbow <unk> even joined me in the festivities !
we grew and grew , we could hear people cheering in the distance , i had finally made it !
but then something weird happened , i started to <unk> out and fall to the ground , i feel this may be my final <unk> <unk> more <unk> hope dad is pro ... . rip little red <unk> <unk>
