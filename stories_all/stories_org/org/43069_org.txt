we had not just one , but two beautiful cakes for the celebration . both lit with a candle .
the round cake is the favorite . the <unk> pattern made with the <unk> is truly artistic .
brother and sister pose in front of the two cakes on the day of the celebration .
grandma was there to celebrate as well . she was happy to be able to be there .
as if the cakes were n't enough , plenty of other small gifts were received on this special day .
