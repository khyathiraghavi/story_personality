i dressed my oldest son as a monkey for halloween .
he loved it but did n't like getting his picture taken .
his friends all wore very cute costumes like bees and dinosaurs .
my youngest did n't wear a costume and just sat in the stroller .
while my wife watched my youngest , i took my oldest son on the bumper cars and showed him how to drive .
