when we went to the big city we decided to go <unk> .
my friend got <unk> close to the cars but they did n't seem to mind .
most of the day it was cloudy but it did not rain on our fun .
i stood next to this courthouse with a giant lion for a photo .
my friend went with his hands behind his back for this shot .
