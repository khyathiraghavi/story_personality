the student was really happy about the road trip she was taking with a fellow <unk> , and she enjoyed taking photos of the freeway they were traveling on .
when the classmates pulled up to a <unk> booth , they both <unk> in their <unk> for dollar bills to pay the <unk> .
when the classmates came upon a bridge that they both remembered from childhood , one of them snapped a quick picture of he bridge for <unk> .
neither of the students had seen snow before , and were really happy to find it snowing during their trip .
as soon as they came upon a rest stop , they stopped the car and got out to walk around and marvel at the snow .
