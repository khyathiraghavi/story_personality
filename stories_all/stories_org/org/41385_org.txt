we headed down to the rodeo to see what was going on with the fair .
we ended up catching a young country band , that was n't half bad .
later we wandered to see a few bike races . was a little boring until the <unk> started up .
some of the bike riders did amazing in the air stunts !
we ended the evening with a ride on the organization organization . what a great evening .
