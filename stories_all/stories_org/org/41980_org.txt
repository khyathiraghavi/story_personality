my friend and i rented a boat for the weekend .
we looked out on the lake and saw how beautiful and calm it was as we went out .
my friend wanted to get a good photo of himself on the dock before it got dark .
the sunset made for beautiful oranges and it was a lovely day .
as the sun <unk> lower in the sky , i reflected on how much fun it was being with my friend that day .
