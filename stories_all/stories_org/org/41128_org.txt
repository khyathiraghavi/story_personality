i was so excited to go to the city for the fireworks display .
the buildings were all lit up with blue and red lights . the night was amazing .
the show was great . so many big bursts of fireworks and lights .
the finale was pink and lit up the whole sky .
the smoke took a while to clear above the buildings from all of the fireworks .
