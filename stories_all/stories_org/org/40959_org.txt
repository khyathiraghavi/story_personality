i will be wearing my special hat to take my family to see the parade .
as i look around i see all the decorations . the town is ready for a celebration .
my son is looking very dapper in his outfit for the parade .
the drummers are warming up before they head down the street .
what a great feeling of accomplishment . the crowd was so happy to hear us .
