on friday evening , we visited location location , and our first stop was the organization organization .
after leaving the memorial , we saw a beautiful view of the location monument .
our friends , <unk> and [ female ] , brought their motorcycle as it was a beautiful evening .
before the sun fully set , we were gathered on the lawn , anxiously awaiting a rally by a <unk> hopeful .
there was a great crowd for the rally . the setting was perfect , as the location building was right behind us .
