from far away the ferris wheel looked simply incredible .
even though the first color <unk> was impressive , as our boat drew closer it displayed an even cooler color <unk> .
as the boat rounded the harbor i was able to get a full shot of all of the buildings , their <unk> lite up now from street lights .
as we were leaving the harbor once more the ferris wheel turned a welcoming blue color , as if to make my depressed mood as it faded away .
i said goodbye to the lovely peer , our ferry now <unk> on into the night .
