today 's race was something we had been looking forward to for weeks .
at the start of the race , everyone got ready at the agreed upon starting point .
by the middle of the race , [ male ] was starting to flag .
he hit a rock in the middle of the road and flew 10 feet through the air !
fortunately [ male ] was there to help him back onto his feet .
