when the fireworks started , <unk> was thinking much about fireworks safety .
it did seem like the fireworks were being set off a bit close to buildings .
but they were so beautiful , <unk> wanted them to stop .
one of the last bursts filled the sky , and made everyone <unk> .
then -- <unk> struck . a <unk> <unk> bit paper on the porch , and the house caught fire and was eventually destroyed .
