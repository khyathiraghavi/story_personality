we went to an outing downtown of fellow cycling enthusiasts .
people came from the surrounding area to show off their bikes and talk about cycling .
as everyone sat around , talking about their bikes , people came to the conclusion that we should all take a midnight bike ride .
some people decided not to take part in it and went home instead .
but for the most part , people decided to take a one hour bike ride around the city . it was a lot of fun .
