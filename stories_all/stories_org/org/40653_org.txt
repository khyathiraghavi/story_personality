i was a little disappointed that not many turned out to see [ male ] 's band play , but they put on a great show .
as it got later , more people did start to turn out , but nothing was going to keep the band from putting on a great show .
this was their <unk> 's first gig with the band , but he did a fantastic job .
[ male ] himself put everything into it .
in the end , even though the weather was n't great and turnout could 've been better , everyone who came had a really good time seeing them play .
