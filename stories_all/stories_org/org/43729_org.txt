just got my real estate license and i have been <unk> at selling all the older victorian houses . this is my first one on the market .
the second house i am trying to sell is actually the newest of all the old victorian homes . this one dates back to <unk>
this on is very quaint for a smaller family looking to open a bed and breakfast .
this home is the best value starting <unk> at $ <unk> .
and this final home on my list is the oldest home . almost has a feel of a castle . it dates back to <unk>
