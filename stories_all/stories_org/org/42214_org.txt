our trip to the <unk> pools started with a plan and a map .
we woke up early and drove through the forest , getting out to see the ocean below .
we hiked down to the rocks , looking for sea life .
the pools are in a beautiful area , below a forest in an amazing cove .
we were lucky enough to get to see to passing whales while we were there .
