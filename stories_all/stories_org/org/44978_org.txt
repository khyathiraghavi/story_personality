today was the day that i had my family come over and where i used my mom 's recipe for all my dishes . we started off with this one as the main dish .
this was the salad to the main dish . i was nervous but it really looks nice and i was pleased with the outcome .
then lastly , i made the dessert that i knew everyone liked that mom used to make .
then i had everyone sit at the table to get a picture and to serve them dinner . everyone loved it !
then i went into the kitchen and saw the mess that i forgot was there . it only took 35 minutes to clean up and it was so worth it !
