this was my first time traveling <unk> . i was so excited .
i 'm not the best photographer , but i got some good pictures of the ancient buildings .
this art was so beautiful .
it was really cold this day , but i still found a good picture of the scenery .
it was kind of dark in this restaurant , but the food was great !
