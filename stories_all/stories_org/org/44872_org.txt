the students proudly <unk> their <unk> booth .
many immigrants in the parade did n't know you could <unk> electronics .
they walked down the street , proud of their mexican heritage , without even <unk> at the organization tent .
gathered in a circle , the foreign students <unk> the <unk> of <unk> warming .
in agreement the location being burnt to a crisp was a bad thing , they ended up at the <unk> booth , seeking information .
