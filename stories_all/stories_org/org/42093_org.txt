the first thing we did on our trip was take a trip down the railroad .
it goes on for a good distance , but it has some interesting scenery .
<unk> we worked our way back in the park and had some fun on the coasters .
after the day was done we headed back to the visitor 's lounge for a bit .
we had some live music and other attractions and spent the rest of the time relaxing .
