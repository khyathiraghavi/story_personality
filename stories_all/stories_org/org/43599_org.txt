this is the back car we rented when we took our trip .
i thought this statue in front of the bed & breakfast was a very ominous presence .
it was amazing seeing all of the historical artifacts while touring the country .
i enjoyed seeing all of the old church <unk> such as this one .
even the <unk> areas had a very old world feel to them .
