the road just behind the lake lay hidden , masked by a large hill , but it was the <unk> point to get there .
passing by the road , almost every day , he wondered where it might lead and what might be on the other end .
the countryside was filled with houses that seemed almost hidden , tucked gently into the hillside .
one of the <unk> always seemed to sneak off , <unk> finding <unk> to get into .
the waves began to grow more and more choppy as the day passed and the onlookers knew a storm would soon be coming .
