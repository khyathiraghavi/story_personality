saturday we all went to [ male ] 's to help him build his shed .
he lives out in the middle of nowhere , and it 's pretty cool .
he has a little trouble with water at times because it comes from a well .
after we built the shed , we had a big bonfire .
then everyone ate until they could n't eat anymore .
