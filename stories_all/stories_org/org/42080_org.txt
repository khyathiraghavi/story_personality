well well well look what i found ! yes im officially engaged !
he finally popped the question after all these years .
after he asked we went on a little hike and saw these awesome trees .
we then celebrated at sunset looking out into the ocean together , it was so romantic .
we ended our trip walking amongst the trees one more time .
