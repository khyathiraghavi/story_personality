a weekend trip out to the farm was just what the family needed .
father and son take some time to play <unk> with the dog in the field .
the puppy sure likes to run around and play in the grass .
look how much mom 's garden has grown since the last time we were here at the family farm .
even both sets of grandparents showed up to enjoy a big , fun , family weekend away from the city .
