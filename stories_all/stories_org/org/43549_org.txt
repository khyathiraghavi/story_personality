<unk> has it that if a train passes between the two street lights at exactly midnight , the ghost of a <unk> woman killed in the spot would appear on the tracks .
so , the lone <unk> <unk> waited .
his confidence began to <unk> as the end of the train got ever closer .
but , even after the train was well out of site , he saw no <unk> .
still , his nerves could n't take it , and he ran .
