the group of friends stayed in a funky cabin for spring break . art <unk> style figurines decorated the exterior of the building .
the red figurine had a solemn facial expression .
but the friends had a great time playing with silly toys .
the star <unk> decor made them think of independence day , which felt appropriate since they were feeling quite <unk> as young men vacationing without family .
the trip was n't all about goofing off . they had fun relaxing at the beautiful beach .
