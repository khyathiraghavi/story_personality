we took the kids to the costume parade in the city .
the kids insisted on dressing up , even though it 's not really a <unk> parade .
i let them , because it 's fun to dress up .
we stayed at a friend 's house , and all crashed on her couch .
the next day , my son [ male ] was up early , eager for the parade !
