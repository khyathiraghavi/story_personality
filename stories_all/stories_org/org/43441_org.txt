my friends and i visited a concert in [ female ] .
one of my favorite bands and group of artists gathered in one place !
some of the band members played saxophone , which i loved to hear .
the other band members played drums , which was very loud and annoying .
the room was packed with music fan cheering and jumping with the music .
