who names a ride <unk> <unk> ' ? it 's a terrifying thought .
but there i was , strapped into it all the same , ready to be ... <unk> , whatever that means .
needless to say , i soon <unk> my decision to go on the ride as it <unk> me around in the air for a very long time . the only thing that felt like it was being <unk> was the back of my <unk> was the <unk> rose and rose .
some <unk> children wearing yellow shirts were about to be the <unk> of my horrible , <unk> <unk> .
thankfully , few noticed it arriving , as every child was <unk> involved in their own games rather than looking to the sky . i suppose it 's good they did n't .
