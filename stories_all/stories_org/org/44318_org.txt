i was looking forward to spending the day with my girlfriend .
as soon as i saw her walking across the park , i got even more excited .
we both love animals , so we had to smile when we saw this dog on our way to the amusement park .
i convinced her to ride with me on the organization wheel , and we had such a great time .
the best part was watching the fireworks go off when we were at the top of the ferris wheel !
