my family <unk> of my father my little brother , and little sister who you can see in this picture posing with their christmas gifts during our favorite season .
my father often ends up helping his baby girl put together her gift on christmas as most fathers do but he loves it as he does her .
i am the the oldest and here you can see me posing for the camera beside the family car cracking a smile for the camera .
i feel like we are the typical american family that goes to church on sunday and gives thanks for the <unk> that he provides to us .
this is what a typical landscape looks like where we live and we give thanks to god every day for the beauty that <unk> us just like we imagine most americans wake up and do every day .
