this quiet , seaside town was the perfect site for me to work on my book .
i rented a bicycle and a room in this cottage .
most days i was in my room upstairs , writing my story .
my neighbor lived here , and she helped me type my work .
when i needed a break or needed inspiration , i 'd bicycle around town , admiring the <unk> lifestyle .
