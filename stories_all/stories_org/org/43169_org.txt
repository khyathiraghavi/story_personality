our home is in the <unk> <unk> .
in one direction is an old pump windmill with a modern wind farm in the distance .
in another is rocks carved by the wind .
anyone familiar with wind <unk> can tell you the wind has been carving the stone here longer than man .
not that man has n't managed to a do a bit of carving themselves .
