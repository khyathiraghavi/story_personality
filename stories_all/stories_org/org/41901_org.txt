today i went to see the ruins of the old city . this is where i began the walk . that resort is new .
this is only part of the foundation . we decided to take a break on the steps here .
here are some columns from the foundation . they made the columns strong back then !
this building is very tall . look at the tiny windows though ! how did anyone get any air ?
this is a photo of inside of the building . it was very interesting and i learned a lot of cool things .
