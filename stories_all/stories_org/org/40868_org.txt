let 's go on a walk through the snowy woods with mom and dad .
the way in is so mysterious and pretty . mom and dad know the way , you could get easy lost in all the trees .
i like the trees , the branches <unk> cross everywhere . they give a unique cover to the place .
mom brought special seeds to attract the birds . they come to her like <unk> .
we got to lead the way back , we had to search the snow for the trail and our footprints .
