this easter we got the whole family together for some outdoor fun .
we had the kids take some time indoors and do some face painting .
the crafts did n't end there we also all took a minute or two to decorate our own egg .
this little doll took two for herself she was just having too much fun .
after our egg hunt we showed our competitive side and played egg toss .
