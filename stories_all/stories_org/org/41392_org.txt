we started our tour of the city here on the bridge where we had to stop and pose for a picture because the cityscape was so beautiful .
there we so many art <unk> on the boardwalk that everyone loved .
the architecture was so different of street to street that it was amazing because you never knew if you were going to see a skyscraper or an ancient cathedral like this one .
after an incredible day of sight seeing we were so tuckered out , but we stopped back by the bridge in order to take a picture from the other side of the water .
the next day , even though we were exhausted from our trip around town yesterday , we were so excited to start the journey all over again .
