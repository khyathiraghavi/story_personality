a field trip to the north pole was not as boring as i thought it would be .
i saw the tallest tree i have ever seen before ,
at the base of the tree there were gifts for all the kids who believe in location .
i saw the prettiest ornament that was made of glass .
my present was a ornament that lit up when on a tree .
