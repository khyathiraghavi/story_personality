my parents and i went to a carnival in the foreign country we were visiting .
the locals had set up a lot of booths to sell fruits and vegetables .
we watched a local rock concert put on at the festival .
later , we rode a carnival ride that was very familiar to us .
the <unk> all showed the temperature in <unk> instead of <unk> .
