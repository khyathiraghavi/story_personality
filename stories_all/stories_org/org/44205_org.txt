we took the girls to the county fair today . it had a special section for kiddie rides .
the girls were so excited , it was hard for them to choose what to do .
they held on tight with this spinning ride .
they loved the car ride .
their favorite ride was the last one they road . it was a roller coaster with a snake head and body . this made their day .
