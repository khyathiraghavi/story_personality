if you work in radio and do a good job , you 've probably been invited to our awards night .
there are some real <unk> that show up every year .
i loved meeting the cast of `` wait , wait , do n't tell me ! `` what a thrill !
there 's a lot of meeting and greeting time too -- <unk> 's a good networking opportunity .
the <unk> golden radio award is always the highlight of the night .
