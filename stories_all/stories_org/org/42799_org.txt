we decided to have our grandparents anniversary celebration at the beach this year .
it was great because a lot of the grandchildren were able to make it in .
of course the guests of honor were happy to see everyone , even though they did n't show it much .
even having the kids gather around them really did n't light them up as much as we had hoped .
but they did seem kind of amused when the fireworks cake showed up .
