the parade was always a fun time for friends to get out , dress silly , and drink a lot of alcohol !
almost everyone wore a costume ; the more <unk> , the better !
red was a popular color chosen by many .
the only people that were n't completely drunk my midday were the ever serious marching band .
after the parade there was a free concert .
