we visited location over the summer for our vacation .
location had some really nice beaches and activities we took part in .
here our family was together at the beach hanging out and enjoying the weather .
there are a lot of historical structures in location as well . we saw some old structures scattered throughout the city .
this church was one of our favorite buildings in location . it was beautiful and the architecture was amazing . all in all , our vacation location was awesome and we would recommend it to others .
