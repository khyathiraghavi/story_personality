i 'm thinking about selling my car .
with some of this damage , i wonder what i can get for the car .
i had n't realized this runner was lifted .
and i knew about his damage , but i think it got <unk> more in the parking lot .
how did i bend the <unk> pipe ? i can not recall this happening . i still wonder what i can sell it for ...
