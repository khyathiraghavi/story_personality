we had breakfast at a restaurant , before heading out on our trip .
first we visited sea world and saw killer whales do tricks in the water .
afterwards we went to a park , that had fields of different colored tulips .
here you see , purple , white and pink colored tulips .
we saw some bikers , on our drive back to our apartment .
