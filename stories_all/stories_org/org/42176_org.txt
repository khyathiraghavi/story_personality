we had been on the beach for a long time , and we were getting tired .
we stood there for a while , looking at the rocks a bit and looking at the islands in the distance too .
we were there on trash collection duty , and we had a job to do . we did it , with a lot of looking around and far less work than we should have .
as everything started to <unk> around us , we worked less and less and stared at the water more and more . we felt lazy , but it was fine .
we decided to stay until the <unk> of <unk> , and light a fire on the beach . we got a little <unk> and headed home early , but we were glad to have been out there .
