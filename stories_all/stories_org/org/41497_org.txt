the city always comes alive when its night time .
everything that you see at night takes on a whole new look
i often look around and wonder where are people going in the am what are they preparing for
i notice detail in store <unk> and wonder when was the building first built what was the city like back then
so beautiful and so regal its almost breathtaking
