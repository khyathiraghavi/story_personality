a very unique parade is taking place in town today .
lots of creative floats and costumes are included in the parade .
how do people even come up with these outfits ?
for example , this is a flock of <unk> chicks and they are all following a giant <unk> float .
look at this <unk> float . where do these ideas come from ?
