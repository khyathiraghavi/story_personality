here we are at the church that is holding a <unk> art display .
this place is huge but there is a crowd that are waiting to go upstairs to see the art work .
here is a famous statue pointing the way to more art .
i thought writing with a pen and paper took along time to write with this would have been <unk> but really cool to see .
i found this to be the most interesting piece of art out of the whole display .
