i just got my <unk> degree and i need to go find my rock on .
i first started here and thought this was interesting .
i then crossed the bridge to get to the other side and see what <unk> was over there .
i climbed to the top of the mountain for some interesting <unk> structures .
i then drove home very <unk> .
