although many people love visiting the <unk> capitol , i have always found it <unk> , with the narrow street and the <unk> .
my hotel was lovely , but it only added to my depressed feeling to be there with all the happy people .
this tree seemed sad , alone in the middle of a cement forest .
the streets were often empty . everything seemed <unk> of life .
i was eager to leave at the <unk> as soon as i could .
