we saw the early <unk> of sunlight from inside the cave , and it made us feel a little less <unk> .
having to <unk> down in the cave for the night , having lost our <unk> on our way out last night , made us feel <unk> . but being able to see the beautiful mountains , what we had came here for , restored our spirits .
we followed the river for some time , remembering that our house was <unk> .
and we found it ! it was n't very long at all .
we had to bring the trip to a close soon , we had nearly missed the <unk> home with the cave incident , but it made us feel that much closer as a group , as people ; as friends .
