the <unk> has become a family tradition for us .
each year my sister , brother , and i bring our families .
the beautifully decorated trees bring nostalgic smiles to our faces .
the ornaments seem become more complex each year .
the trip puts our families in the christmas spirit and kick off the holiday season for us .
