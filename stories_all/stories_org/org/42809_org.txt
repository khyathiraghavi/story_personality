we all decided to check out the new <unk> in town the other night .
it was pretty cool , but it was so dark in there .
i mean they did n't even have normal lighting . we had to stay close just to keep track of each other .
<unk> and [ female ] had a great time though .
even when [ male ] <unk> <unk> to an <unk> contest , that <unk> won by the way .
