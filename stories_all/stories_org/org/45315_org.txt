today i went to the monument for the first time . i watched the soldiers march .
a storm was coming in over the large building .
people were starting to leave . the wind was picking up fast .
i snapped another picture of the building because the sky was getting ominous and so windy .
just then the storm let up and it was calm . the sun shined through and the wind was gone .
