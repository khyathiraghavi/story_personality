my wife wanted to take the family to a camping site , and so we did !
along our hike , we found what appears to be a dead bird .
we stopped by the beautiful bushes that we passed along the way .
there was a lemon orchard that the kids wanted to see .
we drove home on a narrow road with a remarkable amount of traffic .
