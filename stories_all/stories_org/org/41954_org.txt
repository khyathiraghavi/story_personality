we recently <unk> in location .
we spent some time walking along an ocean facing cliff .
we also spent some time in the city . we stopped to watch a <unk> perform .
i was happy to see how much music there was in the city . at one point , during lunch , we were able to listen to an old man with his <unk> guitar !
moved by the music , my boyfriend wanted to visit the cliffs once more to witness nature 's music , the sounds of the ocean crashing upon the shore .
