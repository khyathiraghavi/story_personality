i found a new <unk> flavor today . dark chocolate . i had to give it a try .
each <unk> is individually wrapped . new ! was written across , building up my excitement to try it .
i took my first bite and <unk> it .
first bite and i was done . it did n't taste how i thought it would taste .
now i am left with a full box of dark chocolate <unk> !
