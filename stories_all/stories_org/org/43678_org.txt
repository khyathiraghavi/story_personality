the seaside town we stopped in was very quaint and we enjoyed it despite the overcast weather .
this beach we saw while overlooking from a cliff looks so peaceful .
we found this amazing rock formation along the cliffs near the city .
the city had many large walkways that we enjoyed .
this <unk> was located in one of the parks we encountered during our walk .
