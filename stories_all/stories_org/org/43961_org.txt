we took a lovely trip to location last summer and had such a wonderful time .
the <unk> in the ocean are so charming that it kind of makes me want to live here .
the seagulls can be a problem though , so keep your eyes open .
we even took a ride on a horse drawn carriage to our lovely hotel - now <unk> , [ male ] .
of course , our hotel had a breathtaking view , as does everything else here .
