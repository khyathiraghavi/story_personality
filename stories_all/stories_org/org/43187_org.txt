during our stay we visited a beautiful cannon . the <unk> leading to the cannon were <unk> with rocks <unk> from the cannon .
the cannon itself was huge and seemed <unk> .
we then got to see some men <unk> the boulders into <unk> pieces for , i imagine , the <unk> .
the workers seemed very happy .
on the pathway out we could see their current progress .
