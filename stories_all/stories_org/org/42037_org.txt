we wandered into the hotel lobby to <unk> about breakfast . they had just put out fresh flowers .
my son was in no mood to wait . luckily the dining room was n't busy , so our order was taken right away .
we walked off our big meal by exploring a nearby beach .
my son was fascinated by everything he saw .
we met some nice locals who fell in love with our son !
