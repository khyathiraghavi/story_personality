we decided to take the boat out on the water today , it was a nice day for boating .
this <unk> i am convinced has ate alot , or pretty soon will be expecting some baby <unk> .
this duck seems to be used to humans feeding it , as it walked right up to me when i had my hand full of bread .
as we sailed along , the view of the church was simply breathtaking .
the ferris wheel looked like it was going to touch the water .
