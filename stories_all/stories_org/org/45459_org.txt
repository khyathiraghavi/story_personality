<unk> and [ female ] got engaged last sunday .
we were all very happy for them . they are a great couple .
they posed at church for an official wedding photo .
it looked on the outside like their lives were going to be wonderful .
however , in the parking lot , we witnessed <unk> <unk> [ female ] on the head with a metal bar . they said it was just an <unk> based on where we were standing , but i 'm not sure .
