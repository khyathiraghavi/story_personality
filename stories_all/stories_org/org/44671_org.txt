we visited a beautiful old church .
the church had been erected by the early <unk> .
at the time , they were still <unk> to the [ male ] ; his <unk> is seen outside the door .
i could imagine each brick being placed by a different set of hands ; one community come together to <unk> to a great task .
they built their tribute to god , then sat in <unk> rest at its feet .
