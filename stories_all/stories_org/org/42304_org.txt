i 'm so glad my husband suggested the beach this weekend .
our first night was spent strolling the shore .
we were the first to open our umbrella on the beach the following morning .
seafood is a must on a beach getaway .
our meal so fresh , the fish was straight off the boat . the weekend ended too quickly .
