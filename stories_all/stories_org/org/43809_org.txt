me and my wife went to historic downtown for a day out .
we went to the historic district and walked through the neighborhood .
the sights were beautiful . many historic monuments and buildings were a sight to see .
the beautiful flowing rivers into the city are inspiring .
the district is gorgeous and we are hoping one day we can afford to move into a <unk> or flat in the city center .
