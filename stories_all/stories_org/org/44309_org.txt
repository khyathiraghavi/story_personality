at the end of school , every year our school goes to this nature <unk> for the school trip .
the <unk> had beautiful purple flowers !
they have a lot of wooden bridges , walkways , and <unk> for us to walk on .
they needed to build the pier because they have a lake .
my girlfriend <unk> and i really had a fun time , but thank god we are seniors !
