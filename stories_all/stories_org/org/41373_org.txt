went to our state 's fair this year and it was great . give the man in white 5 dollars and he 'll sing for you .
this was one of the local bands playing . we really had a good time .
we rented a tour of the city boat .
we road the ferris wheel .
this is how far we had to walk to get to it . nice walk though .
