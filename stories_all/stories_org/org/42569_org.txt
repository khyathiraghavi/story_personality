the morning of the race , we greeted each other and exchanged our cards .
the start of the race actually felt quite leisurely .
at times , we were in a group and exchanged a few words as we sped along .
at the end , it was all smiles as we all came to the end <unk> at the same time .
the bikes looked like a pile of <unk> after the race when they were just parked there on the side of the road .
