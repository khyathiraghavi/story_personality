our island vacation was amazing .
we stayed in a bed and breakfast right on the <unk>
every morning we walked out onto the beach , where people liked to relax in the sun .
in town we rented little <unk> to travel through the winding streets .
in the evening we visited the church for a beautiful , holy mass .
