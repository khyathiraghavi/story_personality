on our first trip to location location , we had to take a day trip to location location .
we had heard stories about the <unk> for years , and wanted to experience it ourselves .
the huge wonder wheel was our next target , and it did not disappoint .
this was one of the coolest ferris wheels we had ever been on .
we ended the day with a walk on the beach beside the rides . what an awesome place .
