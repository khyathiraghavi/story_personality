upon looking to buy some old items , we found some old <unk> wheels .
then we saw a bunch of junk and small bottles .
my favorite part was the old newspaper boxes .
and the old fans were pretty cool ; too bad most did not work .
last but not least , i was told all of the phones were hooked up to ring at once !
