on our nature hike , we saw some amazing things .
the rays of the sun coming over the cloud was awe inspiring .
the birds looking for food on the water 's surface gave one pause about how hard they work to survive .
the birds are very majestic in flight .
the sunset across the water is very soothing and calming .
