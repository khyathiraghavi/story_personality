after watching the tour de location , we were inspired to take an advanced bicycle class .
first we <unk> a series of tricky green cones . i swear they kept moving !
we all got in a line behind the instructor for some advanced <unk> .
one of the riders got a bit carried away and rode the wrong way .
after an hour we were all exhausted . except for this one guy who had way too much energy .
