the main course was made using grandma 's recipe for stuffed peppers .
the side <unk> were extra delicious became of the edible bowl that they were in .
of course mom 's desserts looked great also , we call it restaurant style .
in all , the family enjoyed another creative dinner .
and cleaning up was not so bad either , once we all pitched in .
