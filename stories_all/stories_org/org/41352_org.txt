on our vacation we had the chance to sit at the lake and watch the sun go down .
here we are watching the sun come up .
the night we headed to the fair in town to get on the ferris wheel we kept seeing .
a sign we saw and thought oh my . we wo n't be hitting the water .
cute <unk> that watched us closely at the zoo .
