last night 's fireworks show blew me away . this red flower type burst was amazing . it filled the sky .
i liked these lower down <unk> color displays , too .
this one looked like a big <unk> pop in the sky .
this green one reminded me of <unk> <unk> .
and these subtle bursts were great . it was a top notch show .
