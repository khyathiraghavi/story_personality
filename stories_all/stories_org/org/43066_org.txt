this was the first time i had seen my grandmother in ages , and she really went all out in celebration !
here 's me looking <unk> , over her combined <unk> cakes .
this beautiful , <unk> lamp was my going away present , when she presented it to me , i almost <unk> with joy .
she sent me home with these <unk> and treats , too , i almost felt my eyes <unk> up with tears .
i 'll forget a lot of things in life , but i hope i never forget my grandmother 's great party .
