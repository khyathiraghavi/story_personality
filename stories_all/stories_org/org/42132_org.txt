today i made signs for the <unk> rally .
in favor of lighting up those <unk> in public , yes we are !
we went to a local tattoo shop and <unk> our love of <unk> all over ourselves .
we then went to a store and bought a lot of candy and pizza .
lots of people were photographing us dancing naked in the fields all hopped up on <unk> and sugar .
