i had to go to a funeral for two small children .
it was a really emotional day as the people dug the graves in a traditional way for their final resting place .
people put stuff in a little memory box to commemorate their lives that were cut too short .
there were pictures being passed around to remember the two children .
everybody gathered and listened to emotional speeches . it was very moving . i would n't wish this on anybody .
