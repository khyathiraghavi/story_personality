last summer we visited this quaint island just off the coast .
the island is home to many old buildings , like this beautiful old chapel .
the stones on this traditional house were weathered from years of coastal winds .
dark <unk> connected many of the buildings , and the air in here was cool and heavy .
before we left we grabbed this stunning picture of the coastline .
