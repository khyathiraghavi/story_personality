saturday we made a trip up to a local farm to check out some of the animals . first up were horses .
we noticed a friendly dog walking around the farm .
goats were gently <unk> nearby . we saw several baby goats .
next we were allowed to feed a llama .
after viewing the animals , we all met up to enjoy a picnic on the property !
