my friends and i had decided to take part in an annual race that was in my town .
there were lots of bikers in attendance . everyone was ready to have a good time .
[ male ] was falling a little bit behind , but kept pushing through , as the race was for charity .
[ male ] ended up <unk> out towards the end . he does n't look too sad about it though .
after being covered in mud from a couple of falls , we decided to hang up our gear for another day .
