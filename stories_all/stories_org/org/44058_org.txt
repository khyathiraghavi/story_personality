i was strolling through the mountains when i came across a <unk> thing .
i looked to my left and there was a massive rock with a red man painted on it . i immediately photographed it .
strolling around i found some blueberry looking produce .
last , i decided to go take in the nice scenery offered by the lake .
after a long day of exploring the mountain and lake , it was time to hit the road and head home .
