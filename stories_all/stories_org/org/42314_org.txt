we began our trip in an ordinary looking part of the country .
soon we were walking along a winding path surrounded by walls of rock .
we knew we were at our destination when we had to cross a bridge that was <unk> over crystal blue water .
we noticed others were already enjoying their time in the warm water .
besides enjoying the warm water , we had a wonderful view of the mountain .
