this was [ female ] 's first time getting on the rides at the carnival . she was so excited .
i tried to get her to get on the ferris wheel , but she said that it was too high and maybe next time she will .
the bumper cars are definitely my favorite amusement at the carnival .
i ca n't seem to escape spongebob and [ male ] anywhere . they 're everywhere !
there were even gift shops at the carnival . i do n't know who would be looking for a quilt in this hot weather though .
