we went to the carnival together , it was a lot of fun .
many people were dressed up in costume and were having a good time .
some people had crazy outfits , they were really entertaining .
we also went on a few of the rides , they were really cool !
we ended our day with a visit to the beach , even though it was a big crowded .
