the old structures stood tall , as the couple explored the ruins .
they looked at the pieces at all angles , seeing so many sides to the story .
they gazed out at the water , wondering what life was like here so long ago .
not all of it was in great shape , they noted , some did see the test of time .
but in general , the couple was very impressed with the ability of the architecture to stand up to time .
