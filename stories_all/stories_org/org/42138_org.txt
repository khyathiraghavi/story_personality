this is the view at night on our lake side destination !
even the ducks at night are out to enjoy the view .
the lights reflecting off the water right before nightfall offer a scene to remember
a <unk> during the day of the lights , gorgeous view of the lake and snowfall on the <unk> .
and here is another view of the land further out from the lights .
