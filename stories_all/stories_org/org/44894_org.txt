i went bowling on friday night with some old college friends . we had food and drinks .
i bowled a strike a few times but mostly just <unk> .
i had a few cases where the ball went into the <unk> , but it was still fun .
my friend bowled the high score , using his skill he learned in school .
we went to the local store afterwords and found some fun toys .
