saw this cute live action <unk> show called location .
i swear the skeletons from the show were from <unk> <unk> .
even the ferris wheel resembled something out of <unk> .
they even had a show based off the popular orange juice brand .
but by far the most <unk> ride was the ferris wheel of death . it looked like something that could kill you !
