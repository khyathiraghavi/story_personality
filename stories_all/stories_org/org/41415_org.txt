have you ever wondered what happens to a local amusement park when it gets shut down .
most of the time the rides are just left where they are to gather dust .
the carousel horses are taken down and <unk> .
they remove the statues in parts and put them <unk> .
the ferris wheel stands <unk> over the lonely park remembering its <unk> days of providing fun and laughter for the crowd .
