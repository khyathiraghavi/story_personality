i woke up early and heading out to the farm to see how many photos i could get in .
i was happy to come across these cows grazing in the field . one of them really wanted to be photographed !
then i found this duck `` couple `` wandering about . too bad they did n't have any babies .
i came across this old bird house and it made for an excellent shot .
i could spend days photographing this entire area , it 's so beautiful .
