we went on a sight-seeing trip , check out this old <unk> building we saw .
then we saw some amazing graffiti art ; it almost looks 3d .
there was a car that someone completely covered in <unk> notes .
this really old building looks like a castle or a <unk> .
after sight-seeing , we stopped and got some ice cream .
