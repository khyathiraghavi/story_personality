i decided to spend a night out on the town with me and my camera .
i went around to all of the <unk> buildings and photographed their <unk> .
eventually , i stumbled upon some boats and shot them too .
deciding to take a break , i had some drinks in a bar .
then i went to a late night museum to get more inspiration for my photos .
