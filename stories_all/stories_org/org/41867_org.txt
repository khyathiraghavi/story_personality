when we all arrived , we felt ready to cross the hot <unk> .
but we were smart and took the time to look around for a bit before we started .
it looked like we <unk> the only ones here , as we saw an pack animal closer to the cliffs .
they looked so big and the space so narrow once we got closer !
we kept going , finally arriving at the spot we would be going through .
