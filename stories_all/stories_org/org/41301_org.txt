the view of the opera house from the ocean is real spectacular .
the ferris wheel looks like it is going to spin in the water .
i told my husband that i would love the experience of taking a tour on that boat .
this building is beautifully , and <unk> designed .
this building reminded me of a building that my art teacher made us draw in art class .
