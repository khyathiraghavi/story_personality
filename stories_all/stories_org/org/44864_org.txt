i purchase several yards of <unk> like this . this one is a lion 's color .
the pink one i bought will be used for a baby girl 's <unk> .
orange <unk> was what i thought of when i picked this one .
this multicolored yarn gives me so many ideas .
wow , i did n't think that i would go <unk> with buying yarn !
