went out to a craft mall where there were lots of different booths set up .
the basket area was great , with lots of different size baskets .
the jewelry selection available was very nice as well .
one of my favorites was these cute little <unk> wrapped up so neatly .
handmade greeting cards also caught my eye . it was a great day of shopping !
