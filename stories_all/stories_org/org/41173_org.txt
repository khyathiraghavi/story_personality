we saw lots of sights while we were on vacation . there was even a castle .
it was so amazing to see all the big arches up close .
the museum was a favorite stop on our journey and had many amazing things to see .
one of my favorite parts of the trip was getting to relax on the beach .
after dark we got to see all the fountains lit up and working .
