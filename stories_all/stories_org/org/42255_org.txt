my trip to location was fantastic . i spent my first day there on a hike .
the beaches were beautiful and there were tons of surfers out ready to ride the waves .
the food at the hotel was amazing . everything was so <unk> arranged and tasted amazing .
i went sightseeing on horseback and got lots of great pictures .
on my last night , i sat and watched the sunset with a cocktail . it was so relaxing and enjoyable .
