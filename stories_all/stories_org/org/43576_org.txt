we were not sure what to expect when we entered the foreign land , but this castle looking structure was awesome .
we stopped in at a coffee bar to have a drink .
i caught a bird just hanging out on a power line during the day .
the view that we got after leaving the bar was breathtaking to view .
we got to see an african elephant walking around the streets as well .
