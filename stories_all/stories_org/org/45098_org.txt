we went on vacation over the weekend to a local city on the river .
the buildings were old but beautiful .
the river made the city look even more ancient and unique .
we saw this interesting statue of a man standing watch towards the top of a building .
we found out that the man is meant to be a <unk> that stands watch over the river that runs through the city .
