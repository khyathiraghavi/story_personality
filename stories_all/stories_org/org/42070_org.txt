on vacation to location location , we wanted to try out a new mexican restaurant we had heard about .
here it is ! it looks like it is a <unk> <unk> restaurant though . and it looks closed .
we snuck inside anyway , just in case maybe someone was there to make us some food .
nobody was there , so we made our own . chicken wings !
my friend made something <unk> . i 'm not sure what it is , actually . we put money for our food on the counter and left .
