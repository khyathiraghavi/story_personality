i walked into the large catholic church today and i was amazed at the stained glass in there .
it depicted large pictures of [ male ] and <unk> .
it was so beautiful i loved each panel of glass more than the last .
these were in the restroom . i could sit in here for hours staring at the <unk> .
my all time favorite were these ones . it was story depicted in the glass that only i could understand . i loved it so .
