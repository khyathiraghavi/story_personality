someone started a fire in an abandoned car , as it sat by the side of the road . it was late and the sky was dark .
<unk> by gas , the fire quickly <unk> the entire car .
a fire fighter fought the fire .
working quickly , the fire began to <unk> . the glow of red and orange began to <unk> and the roar of the flames became <unk> .
the fire was put out , leaving a trail of smoke that sailed up in the night . a tow truck was on the scene and they got the lift ready so that they could transport the car to a junk yard .
