when i woke up , i found myself in a strange cave .
stepping outside , i discovered that i was in a beautiful landscape !
mountains and streams dotted the countryside all around me .
<unk> <unk> <unk> , i approached the first sign of civilization i found .
thankfully , the house i found was full of friendly travelers who were quite willing to take me along on their journey .
