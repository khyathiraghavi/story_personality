one of my many favorite vacation spots is an old town in location called location .
it has so many interesting and eye <unk> artistic <unk> touches .
my mom used to love the <unk> on corner 's private collection on display in his windows .
they did some crazy folk dances that you wanted to make fun of but you found yourself jumping in to join along .
everywhere you look you can see <unk> <unk> all over town . one thing is for sure you can never call <unk> boring .
