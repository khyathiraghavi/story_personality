it was a breathtaking day in the mountains .
it was the kind of day [ male ] , [ male ] and [ male ] , three brothers from a close <unk> family , really enjoyed .
every now and then , they took a break from their busy lives to <unk> with nature .
on perfect days like this , it was especially rewarding .
it always brought them closer , and reminded them how important it was to stay close to one 's family members .
