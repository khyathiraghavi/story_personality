grandma [ female ] and baby [ female ] wanted to sit some place comfortable before the birthday cake was brought out .
being that it was [ female ] 's first birthday we did n't want to get cake everywhere so [ female ] helped hold her back at times .
a neighborhood friend and her baby decided to drop by to help us celebrate the day .
once the kids had gotten their fill of cake they wanted to go play with some of the <unk> toys in the house .
dad caught one of the kids playing around with something he should n't have been and decided to take it from him .
