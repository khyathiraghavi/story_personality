we went to a flea market last weekend that was really neat .
this lady was the owner and she had a really pretty bird .
she had a lot of <unk> and other old stuff .
she kept a lot of these cases in back with surprises inside of them for people who bought them .
we bought a few of these paintings before going back home that day .
