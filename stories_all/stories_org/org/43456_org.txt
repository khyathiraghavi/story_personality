the scenery at the party was quite unique . it felt like a future space <unk>
people spun lights to make appealing visual patterns in the air
sometimes the lights got so crazy it was hard to follow the patterns .
some of us were dressed rather <unk> .
it was great getting to spend time together with the crew .
