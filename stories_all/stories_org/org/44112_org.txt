karate performers waited onstage while the master spoke .
one student <unk> their skills by <unk> through 3 thick blocks of ice with one hand .
all the white students , regardless of skill , were put up front , per american custom .
one audience member seems <unk> with that custom .
despite cultural <unk> , the performance still brought people together .
