my sister 's first outfit looked like a marching band uniform as she sang onstage .
she quickly changed to a black evening gown that covered her shoulders .
she switched it up halfway through with a red dress that showed off her tattoos .
she ended the night with a green dress that covered everything .
but she got hot and decided to roll up her <unk> at the end to show off her tattoos .
