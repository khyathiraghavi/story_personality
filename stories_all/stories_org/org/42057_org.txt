we decided to take a trip on a <unk> to see the sights along the river which ran through the ancient city .
there were a lot of old buildings along the banks of the river . it was all really pretty , i did n't know where to point my camera next .
the <unk> 's mansion was a sight to behold . there 's so much history here . we could n't go in though , it 's still a private <unk> .
off down the river again . some of these bridges are very low , i keep thinking we 're going to hit one and get stuck !
at the end of the trip we got to sample the local specialty , fried fish . not caught from the river but brought in fresh from the ocean . delicious !
