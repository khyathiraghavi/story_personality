i went to visit a sheep farm in the countryside .
the sheep are sometimes kept in a <unk> .
but they often <unk> in lush green <unk> like this one .
when the sheep went to the pasture , the <unk> and i slept in this hillside hut overnight .
both the <unk> and i found this view beautiful when we got up in the morning .
