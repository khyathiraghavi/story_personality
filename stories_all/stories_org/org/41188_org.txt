the river was pretty silent and serene as we walked along it . it reflected lights from the houses .
we met up with the rest of the town at the assigned meeting spot .
the major made a speech and then she lit a lantern .
she then placed it into the river and watched it as it floated away .
others started lighting up lanterns and it was the start of our annual floating lanterns festival .
