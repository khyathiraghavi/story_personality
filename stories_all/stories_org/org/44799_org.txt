the red barn is very large and even serves as a home !
it could use a little paint in some areas , but it is still a nice barn .
it was a sunny day , so i decided to head out of the barn to enjoy the view .
even the pet cat had decided to take in some of the nice weather .
while i was outside , i took some time to stack some <unk> up neatly .
