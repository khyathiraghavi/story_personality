this island in the middle of the sea has a great history . old buildings still stand in some places .
the pier is from a long time ago , but it has been <unk> to stay available for tourists .
on a tourist tram we see the lush vegetation with the sea in the background .
an abandoned boat sits along the beach . perhaps it still would float .
back at the main tourist area , children and adults play happily in the surf .
