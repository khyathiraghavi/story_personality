i finished my shift at the <unk> cash register in the early afternoon .
so i headed to the beach which had a pretty good crowd near the water .
i was elated at the choice i had made .
i saw a lighthouse in the distance and decided to hike closer to admire the setting .
as i reached the small <unk> near the lighthouse , i could see the ideal access that the lighthouse had to the open sea . it was a very nice afternoon .
