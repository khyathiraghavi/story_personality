i call this picture `` from the outside looking in `` because that is how i feel now after all has happened in my life .
this is how things used to be when she was with me and every day was almost like christmas .
we posed for many pictures and here is one where i was very happy sporting my used to be favorite hat .
still another photo shows maybe what was really going on that i could not see because we are not really touching in this picture .
one day all the lights went out in my life and i lost her and she never even say goodbye or why , leaving me to guess in <unk> for the rest of my life while i <unk> if possible .
