our mini vacation took us on some rail rides . neither one of us had ever been on any <unk> or passenger trains .
i liked the sign that <unk> `` discover the world `` because that was what we were doing on our mini vacation .
the angel statues were incredibly <unk> , but all i could think was about those dr. who <unk> of the angels that attack you .
the architecture was old and grand . we spent hours exploring the biggest buildings .
this angel statue looked lonely and somewhat ominous set against the background of the steel gray sky .
