today i went to an art showing at our local college .
there were artists with paintings displayed and others that were creating art in front of the visitors .
this woman created balloon creatures and figures that were quite impressive .
many of the paintings were by new students trying to make a name for themselves . they served food and refreshments to those of us browsing to keep our interest .
i met many interesting people at the gallery and made a few new friends who shared my art <unk> .
