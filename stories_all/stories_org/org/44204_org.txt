going to a fair is great . but it 's even better for a photographer .
there are so many things to shoot in so many different ways .
but sometimes , shots of <unk> nothing can turn out pretty cool .
even the lights of an old storage shed near the location itself .
and even the subway that we took home can turn into a work of art .
