on our day off we decided to go for an nice bike ride .
the landscape around the area we were riding in was awesome to see .
i always ride with my sunglasses and helmet on for safety .
my boyfriend and i had such a romantic time on the sunny day .
as we neared closer to the end of the ride we could see our house in the distance .
