i always ride the brain buster roller coaster on my birthday . a broken <unk> is n't going to stop me .
the only other transportation available at my home is designed for a <unk> .
nothing was going to stop me , so i walked the train tracks .
it took forever but i finally made it to the amusement park .
that 's me , in the second car , turning green and about to lose my lunch . i ca n't imagine a better way to spend my birthday .
