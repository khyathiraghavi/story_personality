our family took a trip across the ocean last summer . we went to many beautiful cities .
we enjoyed touring all the old architecture the cities had to offer .
there were many interesting things to see , so many things different than our culture at home .
there were many days that the weather <unk> and we were just able to walk around the town and discover many secret places we would n't have known .
on the last day of our trip we came across a beautiful building that my sister thought would be a wonderful location for her wedding . looks like we will be coming back next summer .
