we arrived in the beach community and began the journey toward our new home .
we could n't believe the beauty when we found the home and they even provided a bike for our <unk> to town .
i noticed the porch , while [ male ] was happy to see the air <unk> !
we continued to move around the exterior of the home , loving every second of it .
and , finally , we headed toward the back entrance .
