i went back to my hometown over the weekend and saw my old house .
the fence i had painted many years ago was still painted like that .
the lamp in the window always looked odd to me as a child .
we stopped off at the <unk> of rock <unk> roll while i was there .
this is the most interesting building in the entire town . it took them five years to build .
