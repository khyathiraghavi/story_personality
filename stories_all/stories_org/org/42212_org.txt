according to the map the crew had to hike 15 miles to get to the camp site .
looking out over the water a feeling of peace entered the hiker .
standing on the rocks really reminded everyone to be careful . it was beautiful outside but getting hurt all the way out in the wilderness would not be good .
the view of the beach from all the way up here was amazing .
when they reached the campsite by the ocean , dolphins could be seen from where the tents would go .
