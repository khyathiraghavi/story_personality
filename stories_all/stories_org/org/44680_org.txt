last sunday , i acted as [ male ] pastor at my church .
many people showed up to sing in the choir for the service .
i was a little nervous but the pastor was very patient .
everyone seemed to be listening closely and paying attention .
i noticed many people singing along and <unk> to enjoy the day .
