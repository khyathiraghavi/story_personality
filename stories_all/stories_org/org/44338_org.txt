we gathered for the parade and had a wonderful time .
here i am throwing my hands up to my friends that somehow found me among the big crowed .
wow ! never heard this type of music before .
the dancers were phenomenal .
the karate kids were something out of a movie . definitely do n't want to mess with these guys .
