we were very excited for our trip to the old ruins .
we stopped and looked at the old fire places they had designed many years ago .
we also visited the gardens which had been <unk> recently .
the architecture was absolutely stunning given the age of the ruins .
we had a great time visiting the ruins . we left amazed by the <unk> of the humans that came before us .
