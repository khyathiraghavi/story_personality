this guy decided that he wanted highlights in his hair , so he asked his girlfriend for help .
she laughed because she knew he was not going to enjoy the process , but she agreed to do it anyway .
since they had no <unk> , she cut a hole in a trash bag and placed it over his head .
he was skeptical when she first washed out his hair . he was not at all sure that he was going to like it .
turns out , he was right . he did n't like it , but he knew that it would grow out so he was n't too upset .
