they are meeting their friends after their high school reunion .
they look at some old letters that they wrote to themselves several years ago . some kept their <unk> and others did n't .
after that it is time to mix and mingle and meet up with buddies we have n't seen in a while .
this guy is still the life of the party .
it is funny how much we still have in common after so many years .
