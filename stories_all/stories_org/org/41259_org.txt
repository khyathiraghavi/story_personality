we arrived at the amusement park early in the morning .
we wanted to get there early so we would n't have to wait on long lines to get on the rides .
we rode on a pretty neat <unk> tram that took us from one end of the park to another .
then it was time to get on a rollercoaster in the shape of a train . it was so scary .
the coaster went under a waterfall and we all got wet . we decided to get some food and take a break for an hour to dry off . it was a good day .
