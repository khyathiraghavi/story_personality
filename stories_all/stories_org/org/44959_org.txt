it can be tricky to get a pot truly clean once food is stuck to it .
start with really hot water and soap .
make sure that the post is wet on both sides .
once wet and <unk> , use a tool to <unk> off the burned material .
once done , let the pan continue to <unk> to <unk> any additional attached food .
