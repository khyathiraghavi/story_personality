it was a nice winter day and i wanted to go on a stroll .
so i gathered my family and we walked along the shoreline .
we were surprised to be able to find swans so late in the season .
my children were delighted to be able to attend to see the birds in the winter .
we walked until dusk then went home and drink some hot cocoa by the fireplace .
