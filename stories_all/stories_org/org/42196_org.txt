the view of the mountains was the inspiration for the trip .
as they got closer they started to see the wildlife .
the cabin they rented was just on the other side of the lake .
they arrived a found the cozy cabin waiting for them .
after unpacking , the friends went out to enjoy the fresh , cold mountain air .
