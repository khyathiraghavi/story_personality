on the first day of our vacation , we went sight-seeing on the edge of a rocky cliff .
we hiked across a grassy plain and enjoyed the weather .
on the next day , we visited the nearby city .
all of the buildings were tall and magnificent .
at the end of the day , everyone was tired of <unk> and ready for bed .
