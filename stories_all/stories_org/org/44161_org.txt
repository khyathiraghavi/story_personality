it was a beautiful fall day so we decided to go for a drive into the country and look at the leaves .
unfortunately we were n't the only ones with that idea , and got stuck in traffic because of this accident .
i was very disappointed that i only had roadside weeds to look at instead of fall colors .
looking around once we got past the traffic , i did see some really lovely view of the <unk> .
in the end it was worth the trouble because it turned out to be a beautiful autumn day .
