there was a bright ball off in the distance . we wondered what it could be .
the orange glow began to grow . our hearts started to beat faster .
in an <unk> we knew it was a forest fire . the orange glow and smoke took over the sky .
we began to see flames <unk> up over the trees . <unk> could be heard off in the distance .
as we hoped and prayed that everyone was okay , the fire trucks were clearly on their way to fight this amazing fire .
