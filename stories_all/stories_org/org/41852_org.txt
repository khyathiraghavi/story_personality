me and my group are very involved with the `` save the location location `` movement .
we went on a day to take pictures of damaged buildings and coast line like this .
this wall is <unk> and may fall apart if people such as my group do not <unk> .
here is another example of some of the <unk> we faced on our trip .
it is possible to <unk> places like this back to glory . we just need to keep coming back and working hard !
