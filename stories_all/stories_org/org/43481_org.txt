the day after the snowstorm we woke up to the entire yard looking like a winter wonderland .
our little girl immediately had to run out side to play in the snow .
we soon noticed that the heavy snow had damaged some of our pine trees on the side of the house .
luckily it was only part of one of the trees and we can take care of it after the snow <unk> .
she did an excellent job creating her snow man today !
