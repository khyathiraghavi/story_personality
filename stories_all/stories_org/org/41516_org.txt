the amusement park was packed today , we couldnt wait to get on some rides .
the park had some pretty nice views , that water looked pretty dirty though .
we couldnt wait to ride this bad boy , it was huge !
the turns were intense , hard to keep your hand up .
after the ride we were relieved it was over but couldnt wait to get on another !
