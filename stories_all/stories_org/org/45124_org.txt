saturday morning was the perfect time to take a stroll downtown for the farmer 's market .
we approached the town square where people were busy setting up their tables .
it looks like we got to the square early before all of the big crowds arrive later this afternoon .
so many flowers and plants on display . it will be hard to pick <unk> one batch to take home to the wife .
i always love buying from the vendor in the blue tent . he has the best selection of flowers and always throws in a little extra something for his <unk> .
